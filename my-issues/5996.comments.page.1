I have thought about several ways to work around this without sacrificing efficiency, but I don't quite know how to do so for now. Best I can think of is to represent terms with a cache storing an environment and an evarmap in which they are known to be typeable, and check by pointer equality that if they have changed in the meantime, we need to recompute the type. But that's still quite expensive probably.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420281458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420287537","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5996#issuecomment-420287537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5996","id":420287537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDI4NzUzNw==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T14:08:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T14:08:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Regarding the environment part:\r\nWe only care about changes when the new environment closes over a name present in the old environment, but with the wrong type.

Mtac has the same problem actually, and they solve it quite elegantly thanks to the fact that evars in the object and meta language coincide (they are the same). Another solution for Ltac would be to disallow exceptions returning data, but then you also have the same problem with non-backtracking mutable state, and it looks like we really want that one. Once again, the solution would be some richer type-and-runtime system, but then this does not fit within the backwards compatibility requirements of Ltac2, so that we have to resort to dynamic checks instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420292433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420302309","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5996#issuecomment-420302309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5996","id":420302309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDMwMjMwOQ==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T14:51:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T14:51:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you be more specific about how it doesn't scale to complex datatypes?  I see that general environment transformations don't scale (this is just a slight variant of my `rename` example), but I think that if we only need to do this check on context extensions (when we are closing over a free variable to make it no longer free), pointer equality on the types should suffice.  That is, I cannot imagine a context Γ where `t` is well-typed, `T` is a well-formed type, either `x` does not appear in Γ or the `x` in Γ has a type which is pointer-equal to `T` and has no body, but yet `fun x : T => t` is not well-typed.  Similarly, I cannot imagine a context Γ where `t` is well-typed, `T` is a well-formed type, `b` is well-typed of type `T`, either `x` does not appear in Γ or the `x` in Γ has a type which is pointer-equal to `T` and has a body which is pointer-equal to `b`, but yet `let x : T := b in t` is not well-typed.\r\n\r\n  My current picture is that for any term `t` and any context `Γ` in which `t` is well-typed, we can divide `Γ` up into two (mutually dependent) lists: `Γ₁` containing all names which occur free in the term `t`, and `Γ₂` containing all other names in `Γ`.  Having made this divide, `t` should be well-typed in any choice of `Γ₂` which results in a well-typed context when interleaved with `Γ₁`.  Thus, since all operations should preserve the well-typedness of the context/environment, and more-over the only operation that calls this check is adding new binders \r\n\r\nFor the evarmap, what about making the default way of catching exceptions retype any constrs that live in the exception data (which may be expensive for exception data containing constr, but should be free for, e.g., string-data exceptions), and provide an unsafe way of catching exceptions (or an unsafe wrapper for exception data that says \"don't retype me, here be dragons\").  Would this work?  My goal is that Ltac2 should allow users who want fast code and know what they're doing to get fast code, and should also make it hard for users who don't know what they're doing to shoot themselves in the foot (at least behavior-wise) without noticing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420302309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/420341692","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5996#issuecomment-420341692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5996","id":420341692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDM0MTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T16:48:32Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T16:48:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Can you be more specific about how it doesn't scale to complex datatypes?\r\n\r\nHow do you perform variable expansion on closures returning or taking terms as arguments?
