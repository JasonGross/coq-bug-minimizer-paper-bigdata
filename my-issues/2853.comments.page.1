There's a close variant that's still open in v8.6 as of a few weeks ago, I believe?  That one doesn't give an interrupted term, but gives an anomaly about a missing feedback_id or something.  I think I got it when interrupting [Print giganic_term] (this is the same term that native_compute generates a 25M file for).  If you can't reproduce, I can try to strum up a concrete example, but it should work on anything that takes 5+ seconds in Coq-land before it starts displaying anything.   I'll plan to take a look at this tomorrow or so and close or update this bug report, and maybe make a new one for the other anomaly.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511490","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/2853#issuecomment-337511490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/2853","id":337511490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxMTQ5MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T07:58:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T08:55:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ejgallego\n\nI think the anomaly in 8.6 is going to have very different causes as the underlying code is fully different.
