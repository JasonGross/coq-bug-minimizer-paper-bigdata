author: @herbelin\n\nActually, your example was working because of a de Bruijn bug which was computing a dependency in x (hence a generalization to do), while it was supposed to find a generalization over the type n (which is unknown at this time hence possibly dependent on m).\n\nFor instance, in released 8.6 (or 8.5), it fails with the following small change\n\nRequire Import Vector.\nFixpoint nth_default {A m} (d:A) (x: Vector.t A m) n : A :=\n  match m, n with\n  | O, _ => d\n  | S m', O => @ hd A m' x\n  | S m', S n' => nth_default d (tl x) n'\n  end.\n\nOf if you change it to\n\nRequire Import Vector.\nFixpoint nth_default {A m} (d:A) (n:nat) (x: Vector.t A m) : A :=\n  match m, n with\n  | O, _ => d\n  | S m', O => @ hd A m' x\n  | S m', S n' => nth_default d n' (tl x)\n  end.\n\nI'm sorry, but I guess that, until compilation of pattern-matching improves, we have to accept the failure of your example...\n\nWe can reconsider it as a wish for pattern-matching improvement, or as invalid.\n\nit also fails.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337553499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
