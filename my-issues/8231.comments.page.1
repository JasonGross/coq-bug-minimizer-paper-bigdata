That is, the evar could carry an optional identifier that would be used only for printing, and `evar (x : nat)` would give the name `x` to the generated evar rather than trying to come up with a fresh name.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that the evar naming mechanism tries to solve two distinct problems:\r\n1. giving a way to access evars inside a script by some handle which happens to be a name;\r\n2. providing the user with a meaningful printing heuristic for evars instead of the horrible old `?1234` style.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason that the two should be sharing the same data. In practice, generating name for evars has already been at the root of other complexity issues (I don't remember the exact bug number though), and the fact that the `evar` tactic generates fresh evar names means that they're essentially unusable for tactic automation, so this is clearly an instance of 2. above.\r\n\r\n@JasonGross what is the expected semantics of `epose` regarding TC? I think it is better to provide really atomic tactics, and relying on pose for evar creation looks anything but atomic...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/412596160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/412599608","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8231#issuecomment-412599608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8231","id":412599608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjU5OTYwOA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T17:31:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T17:31:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The intended semantics of `epose` are the ones given by\r\n```coq\r\nTactic Notation \"epose\" open_constr(c) := pose c.\r\nTactic Notation \"epose\" \"(\" ident(h) \":=\" open_constr(c) \")\" := pose (h := c).\r\nTactic Notation \"epose\" open_constr(c) \"as\" ident(h) := pose c as h.\r\n```\r\nand similarly if there are more variants of `pose`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/412599608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/412632925","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8231#issuecomment-412632925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8231","id":412632925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjYzMjkyNQ==","user":{"login":"herbelin","id":460771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDc3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/460771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin","html_url":"https://github.com/herbelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T19:19:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T19:19:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ppedrot: ok to have mechanism 2 (a name used as hint for printing, with no cost at creation time).
