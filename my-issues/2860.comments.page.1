The question of also providing eta-reduction (or eta-expansion) as a user reduction (expansion) tool is probably relevant. In general, eta-reduction can be ill-typed because of subtyping (considered e.g. `fun x:Type(1) => f x` for `f: Type(2)->Prop`) but up to a test for ensuring typing, this would probably be a nice feature so as at least to simplify the displaying of term.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
