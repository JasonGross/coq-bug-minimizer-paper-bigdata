Coq disagrees:
```coq
Goal forall (f g : nat -> nat) x y, (forall a, f a = g a) -> f x = f y.
intros f g x y H.
rewrite H. (* g x = f y *)
Undo.
rewrite ?H. (* g x = g y *)
```

The documentation says "? (without natural) performs the rewrite as many times as possible (possibly zero times)."  I believe `try` is `1?`.
You're right
