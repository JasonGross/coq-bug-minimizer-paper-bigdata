Much like there is now [Declare Equivalent Keys] for keyed unification, there should be [Declare Equivalent Search Terms] or similar, so that if I have [Definition Foo x := Bar (f x)], and I [Declare Equivalent Search Terms Foo Bar], then [SearchAbout (Foo _ -> Foo _ -> nat)] will also tell me about theorems of type [Bar (f _) -> Foo _ -> nat], [Bar (f _) -> Bar (f _) -> nat], etc.  (It would not be terrible if it told me about theorems of the form [Bar _ -> Bar _ -> nat], too, instead of just [Bar (f _)] ones.)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337529023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
