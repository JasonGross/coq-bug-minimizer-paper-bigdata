Like, would it be enough to have [...] call itself recursively when it hits `SFBmodule`?\r\n\r\nQuite probably yes (feel free to open a PR).\r\n\r\nHowever, as noticed by Pierre Marie, this would remain incomplete (I wouldn't bet for unsound but he certainly knows better than me). Having something complete seems feasible but requires some work which I didn't found time for yet (unlikely to change in a near future unfortunately). So, if you want to dig into this, feel free to, but the best I can promise is a careful review (maybe could I trade it for a review of #12218 ;-) ).\r\nThanks for reporting anyway!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/675417520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
