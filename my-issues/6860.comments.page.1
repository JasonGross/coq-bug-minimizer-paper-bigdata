we should ask @JasonGross to show his real file, this one seems a bit ad hoc.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no real file; I was answering a StackOverflow question, and the timing profile seemed a bit suspicious ( given that my understanding of `rewrite` is that it would look at all of the occurrences of `orb _ _` (up to beta), and then try to unify the second argument with `true`, and this unification should be instantaneous to fail because the term should always be ` false`, and thus it seems like it should be the same performance as ` match` with `constr_eq`... but my guess for the bottleneck in the ` match` with `constr_eq` was the overhead of binding Ltac contexts, which shouldn't show up in `rewrite`, and so this had me confused about the slowness of `rewrite`).\r\n\r\nSo this isn't an example of \"this thing is painful for me, please fix\", but instead \"this seems like it might reveal the root cause of a bit of unnecessary slowness in Coq, so hopefully fixing whatever shows up in this can help make Coq incrementally faster.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/369248892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/369251263","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6860#issuecomment-369251263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6860","id":369251263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTI1MTI2Mw==","user":{"login":"gares","id":1013846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1013846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares","html_url":"https://github.com/gares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T14:12:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T14:12:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK,
