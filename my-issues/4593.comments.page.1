seem to be several requests to me, depending on whether pattern-matching on the type of the source is needed or not, and depending on whether the target is a variable or not:\r\n\r\n- #4593 (initial) and #2927: Extra arguments unbound in the type of the source as in `Axiom f : forall {_ : Funext}, A -> B. Coercion f : A >-> B.` (above) or as in `Coercion coerce_p_to_d : forall (s0 : second_model) (w : W s0), P s0 -> D (s s0 w)` (#2927).\r\n\r\n  This seems independent of the coercion mechanism: there is an argument which cannot be inferred by unification with the type of the source (but type classes or unification with the type of the target would allow to infer it).\r\n\r\n- #2828, #4141, #4635, #4593 (previous comment), #4507 (presumably): Coercion source is a constant but not of atomic form as in `Coercion fourBytesToWord: Vector.t Byte.byte 4 >-> word`\r\n\r\n  This is a case where the coercion mechanism needs to look at more than the head constant of the source to know if the coercion applies. So, I would say that it is about generalizing the matching of a coercion source from a pattern of the form `head ?arg1 ... ?argn` to an arbitrary (say applicative) pattern. This raises the following questions:\r\n  - How to compute the transitive closure of coercions? This would require unification between the source of a coercion and the target of another. A priori possible.\r\n  - How to disambiguate when several coercions apply? Either by allowing only one coercion by pair of source-head/target-head (as of now) but that seems restrictive. Or an order on the precision of the pattern?\r\n\r\n- Yes another issue would be to accept coercions where the target type is bound in the type of the source as in `Coercion FST A B (p : prod A B) := fst p.`. This may require an additional notion of coercion class, say `ParamClass`??\r\n\r\nWondering about the opinion of @coq/pretyper-maintainers. Wondering also whether outside help would be required. Wondering about whether such issues are already studied somewhere else?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/812716583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/813239286","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4593#issuecomment-813239286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4593","id":813239286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzIzOTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"gares","id":1013846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1013846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares","html_url":"https://github.com/gares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gares/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-05T07:16:03Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T07:16:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The general issue with coercions is Coq is that there were designed as if elaborations (type inference and unification) did not exist.
