Although, it would also be convenient to have a way to convert a nested sigT equality into a eq_rect equality, to facilitate substitution or rewriting of the non-eq_rect side.\n\nI also suggest adding a recursive notation for the nested existTs, such as:\n\nNotation \"[ x  ⋮  ..  ⋮  y  ⋮  z ]\" := (existT _ x .. (existT _ y z ) ..).\n\nI have been experimenting with a tactic that generates the nested sigT equality:\n\nhttps://github.com/jonleivent/deptacs/blob/master/sigTgen.v\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545839","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4981#issuecomment-337545839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4981","id":337545839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NTgzOQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T21:34:27Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:36:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nHere's your tactic for converting nested sigma equality into eq_rect equality (unless the equality is used dependently, in which case you need to be fancier):\nhttps://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/blob/9fbef8488c746675eb873094e7f7505e1c63a913/src/Util/Sigma.v#L209\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545840","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4981#issuecomment-337545840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4981","id":337545840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NTg0MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T16:50:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:36:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @mattam82\n\nIt is already implemented in the Equations package which defines its own dependent destruction tactics, based on equality of telescopes, and using available instances of EqDec/UIP when necessary.
