Top\nDefinition.v\n$ cat Definition.v\nAxiom a : Set.\n$ coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile\n$ make\nCOQDEP Definition.v\nCOQC Definition.v\n\nSuppose I then run this:\n Require Top.Definition.\n Locate a. (* Constant Top.Definition.a (shorter name to refer to it in current \ncontext is Definition.a) *)\n Set Search Output Name Only.\n SearchPattern _ inside Top.Definition. (* Definition.a *)\n\nBoth Locate and SearchPattern are giving me invalid names, since [Definition.a] \nis not valid.  Worse, I cannot feed the output of [SearchPattern] into \n[Locate], because [Locate Definition.a] is a syntax error.\n\nContext: Fiat-Crypto has some files named Definition.v, and I'm trying to write \na tool that lists all identifiers that are not closed under the global context.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337555648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
