Note that the autogenerated files have 56640 non-whitespace lines total (4527 unique lines), which amounts to an average of just under 10 lines per file.  The maximum dependency-chain length among the autogenerated files is 4; every curve has a `Synthesis.v` file which depends on a `CurveParameters.v` file which depends on only non-autogenerated files.  Each curve has a number of operation synthesis files (`femul.v`, `feadd.v`, `feopp.v`, `fesub.v`, etc) which depend only on `Synthesis.v`, and each of these has a corresponding `fe*Display.v` file which depends only on the corresponding `fe*.v` file and one additional non-autogenerated file.  Each directory of autogenerated files is completely independent from all other autogenerated directories.\r\n\r\nIt would be reasonable to split off the 524 non-autogenerated files into a separate project, and have one project of autogenerated files.
