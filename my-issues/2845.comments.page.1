It would be nice if there was a variant of \"change ... with ... in *\" that would do this, and would not fail with \"Error: Cannot create self-referring hypothesis ...\".  Here is a minimal example:\r\n```coq\r\n  Goal 1 + 1 = 2.\r\n    assert (1 = 1) by reflexivity.\r\n    pose 1 as one.\r\n    (* change 1 with one in *. *) (* errors with \"Error: Cannot create self-referring hypothesis one\" *)\r\n      repeat match goal with\r\n               | [ H : _ |- _ ] => progress change 1 with one in H |- *\r\n             end.\r\n```\r\nThis change would make [change] consistent with [rewrite ... in *]:\r\n```coq\r\n  Goal 1 + 1 = 2.\r\n    assert (1 = 1) by reflexivity.\r\n    pose 1 as one.\r\n    let H := fresh in assert (H : 1 = one) by reflexivity;\r\n      rewrite H in *.\r\n```\r\ndoes what I expect it to (that is, [rewrite] does not fail).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
