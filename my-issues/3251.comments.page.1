Run over ssh is a very good idea, and I'd love to have it too.  Time permitting I would even code it.  \n\nIn case you decide to work on that I think that the best\nis to make Spawn/Spawned more general and a bit more flexible.  For example right now the master expects the slave to connect back and it opens 2 channels.\nOne can be a pipe (via ssh stdin/out), but the other (the control channel) is a socket.  Via ssh you may need to ask ssh to forward local ports to deal with that (the ip may not be public or be firewalled).  Or simply make the control channel Spawn uses optional (something that may also help the other GUIs).  Right now the control channel is just there to send a death sentence or ask for Gc stats.\n\nCheers\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518123","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3251#issuecomment-337518123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3251","id":337518123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxODEyMw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-07T08:48:10Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:14:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nI meant \"have a terminal/console mode\".
