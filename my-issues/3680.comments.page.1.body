The message "Error: Conversion test raised an anomaly", e.g., on some [refine]s, is mostly useless.  It should mention which anomaly was raised.

I don't think so. It should not mention any anomaly at all, because this error should not appear. The true problem is that we should not feed ill-typed terms to functions from the kernel.
