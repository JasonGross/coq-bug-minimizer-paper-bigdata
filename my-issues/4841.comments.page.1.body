In Coq 8.4, -verbose just printed each line as it was processed.  This is my desired behavior; it allows me to see how fast a file is processed.  In 8.5, it also prints the intermediate goals, which is definitely not what I want.  Please fix/revert the behavior of this flag (and if there is demand for goal printing separate from -emacs, make a new flag with a different name)
