author: @gares\n\nMy understanding is that \"proof progress\" (evar instantiation) is not internally performed by unifying the evar representing the current goal with term produced by the tactic, but rather by blindly assigning the term to the evar (here this results in a cyclic substitution).\nUnification should perform occur check, and hence avoid this problem.\n\nI have not looked at the code to see if this assignment is performed in\na single place, and hence if the bug can be easily fixed...\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337527640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337527642","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3828#issuecomment-337527642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3828","id":337527642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyNzY0Mg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-26T10:02:06Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:41:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
