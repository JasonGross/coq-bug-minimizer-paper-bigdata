In Coq 8.5,
  Global Set Warnings.
gives "Warning: There is no option Warnings.", but
  Global Set Warnings "-all".
gives "Error: There is no option Warnings."

This seems like a major design flaw in terms of backwards compatibility of 
options that take strings.

Maxime, are you the right person for this, or is there someone else in charge 
of options?

Fixed in v8.5 branch (was already fixed in v8.6). Thanks for reporting!
