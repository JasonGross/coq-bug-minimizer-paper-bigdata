So it's possible my diagnosis is a bad one, but I don't see what else fits the facts of:\r\n1. I get `Not_found` in all cases where I invoke `Declare.declare_constant` on a constant which results in a type error whose printing involves a constant which was only defined in a side-effect of the constant I'm declaring (e.g., via `abstract`)\r\n2. I get a valid error message when the type error comes from `Defined.` rather than from `Declare.declare_constant`, which in fact mentions the constant introduced by `abstract`\r\n\r\nAnd, unfortunately, I don't actually know Coq well enough (yet) to be able to point at bits of Coq code with more resolution than that, and I probably am not telling you anything you don't already know here.
