author: @herbelin\n\nLong time ago (18 July 2007), I introduced an upstream check that \"ident\" should be fresh in intro, fresh, move, rename, fix, cofix, generalize, pose and co, as well as \"ident\" arguments of tactic notations or ml tactics. In the case of the primitive tactics above, this is \"excès de zèle\" in the sense that these primitive tactics anyway check the freshness.\n\nIn the case of \"TACTIC EXTEND\" ml tactics and tactic notations, the check is not done (clause Not_found of interp_ident_gen) unless the tactic is called with an ltac variable (as in the current report), so relaxing the freshness test would simply align the calls via an ltac variable to the call made directly.\n\nSo, I'm reverting this old freshness test, hoping I'm not overlooking something. \n\nThis closes this report, even if this does not solve the question of unifying the syntax of destruct and dependent destruction, since \"dependent destruction term\" is e.g. not supported, and using `Tactic Notation \"dependent\" \"induction\" constr(H) := ...' would not solve the problem since it would not cover the case of H is a quantified variable.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337531159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
