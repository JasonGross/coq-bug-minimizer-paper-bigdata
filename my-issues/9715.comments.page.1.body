I suppose I should copy my reply, then, and move discussion here:
I agree that `Set Printing All` is not unreasonable (though there are [other](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9716) [bugs](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6613) that mean that even with `Set Printing All`, `Print Ltac` does not round-trip).  However, I don't think the time overhead in `Print Ltac` is significant.  Even if it takes a full second to print my complicated tactic, that's fine, because `Print Ltac` is not a bottleneck in most compile-edit-debug cycles.  (Goal printing time, on the other hand, is absolutely a bottleneck in many cases.)

The Coq quotation system has to be improved indeed.
