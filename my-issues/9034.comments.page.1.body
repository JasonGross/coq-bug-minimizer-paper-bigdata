Same as #8909, actually.
@ppedrot Wait, really?  I thought #8909 was about binder naming slowness, and this version shouldn't spend too much time on binder naming?
Why not? The `x` definitions do contain an important number of binders.
More precisely, the phase that hides the definition through the notation happens after the binder allocation, which thus cannot be delayed, if this is what is puzzling you.
Huh.  In that case, I'd very much like to see a fix to #8909 (even at the cost of compatibility for printing, which is not a thing I care about super-much).
I'm working on that.
