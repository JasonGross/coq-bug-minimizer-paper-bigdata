So adding yoursef as CC: to your own bugs shouldn't be necessary.\n\nThere used to be problems with some accounts (especially the one created automatically during last bug-tracker transition), but this is supposed to be solved now.\n\nCould you please confirm what are the settings in the \"email\" tab in the preferences of your bugzilla account ?

Sorry for the spurious bug report.
