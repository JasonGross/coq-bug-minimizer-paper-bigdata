While this is necessary in presence of universe polymorphic constants (f (* i *)), the case were the term mentions only Type i's can be handled by a variant of conversion with inference I already used in evar_conv_x (refine's unification algorithm). Reallowing it speeds things up significantly.\n\n- Some tactics were redoing nf_evars when the shouldn't, resulting in additional slowdowns.\n\n- For revert p/generalize p or dep, this seems to be due to the fact that the tactic is coded in old-style with the refiner, letting it do a check that the clear tactic does after it and this means retypechecking the entire goal. This takes quite some time indeed (a \"match goal with |= ?G => let U := type of G in itdac end\" takes about the same time), mainly due to old-style universe polymorphism I guess. As an exercise, I recoded both tactics in the new engine, and they're much faster than 8.4. In general, I think we will see many improvements by recoding the existing tactics with clever checks for correctness that don't rely on retypechecking the whole goal. For revert id, we just need to ensure that no hypothesis in the remaining context depends on id. For generalize c, it's a bit more complicated, we need to check that the transitive closure of hypotheses depending on c does not appear in the goal. Once this is checked, the tactics can actually be trusted and use a fast path that does not recheck the whole goal during refinement.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519074","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3302#issuecomment-337519074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3302","id":337519074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTA3NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-08T14:38:06Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:16:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\n> For revert id, we just need to ensure that no hypothesis in the remaining context depends on id.\n\nYou need a bit more than this, no?
