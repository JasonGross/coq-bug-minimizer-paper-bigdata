(* instantiate the evar *)\n\nThis inconsistency was removed in 8.5 (f4a8b00f, Nov 2014), but indeed, this introduces incompatibilities.\n\nNote that the machinery to freeze evars already exists in the code of rewrite, so it is basically a matter of design decision to possibly add a modifier \"freezing evars\" to \"rewrite\" so that, say, \"freezing evars in rewrite H\" freezes preexisting evars.
