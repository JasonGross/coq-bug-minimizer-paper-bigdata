I do not know what you mean by \"referential transparency\" as Ltac is an effectful language, so that virtually no construction is pure.\n\n> I think [instantiate] needs to be implemented in 8.5 as a synchronization\n> point (does \"[ > idtac.. ]\" have the right semantics for this?)\n\nCurrently, and rightly, instantiate is more or less a no-op. What do you call a synchronization point? Can you describe it by means of an equation?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541944","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4697#issuecomment-337541944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4697","id":337541944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MTk0NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T21:47:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:23:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nSorry, I was mistaken about referential transparency.

There are a lot of large developments here and there that crucially rely on Coq and which seriously need a form of stability.\n\nThere are different strategies possible to ensure some form of stability while still \"as objectively as possible\" improving a system which encountered success before being \"satisfactorily cleaned\" (whatever subjectivity this expression contains), but as a general rule, we should make an effort in motivating incompatible changes, in providing migration policy, in tracing the changes. Not only it will be useful for the users, but I think it will be useful for the developers as well, so as to better understand the underlying room for manoeuver in designing the different components of Coq.\n\nAs for the associativity of \";\", we had long discussions with Arnaud. Considering that in the vast majority of cases, the change of semantics of \";\" between 8.4 and 8.5 was not breaking scripts (one or two cases in our test-suite of user contributions iirc), we agreed on keeping the same notation \";\" for the non-associative pre-8.5 \";\" and for the more primitive associative \";\" of 8.5, even if a change of habits for people used to the LCF model, who, strictly speaking, would indeed now have to write \"tac ; [> tac' .. ]\" to emulate the 8.4 \";\".\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
