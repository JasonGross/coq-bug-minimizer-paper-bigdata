My initial version of a PR template had this but it was deemed to heavy so IÂ stripped a lot of things. Feel free to open a PR to add this checkbox. The main problem is that it's not very clear when exactly we should add test files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/392525569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/392534761","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7617#issuecomment-392534761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/7617","id":392534761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjUzNDc2MQ==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-28T13:59:38Z","updated_at":"2018-05-28T13:59:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My rule of thumb is that test-suite files should always be added for any change that impacts the behavior of `coqtop`, `coqc`, `coqchk`, probably `coq_makefile`, etc, unless either\r\n(a) figuring out how to write an appropriate test-suite file would significantly delay submitting the PR\r\n(b) a test-suite file testing the behavior already exists, or\r\n(c) a test-suite file would be prohibitively expensive or non-deterministic in unacceptable ways\r\n\r\nI think (a) and (c) tend to apply to perf-related improvements.  At present, I expect (a) applies to most API changes, but hopefully someday we'll have unit tests with 100% code coverage and then it won't be hard to add/update tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/392534761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
