This is e.g. how we can simulate Coq on top of Arnaud's presentation of a CIC with only a primitive collection of algebraic types (empty, unit, sum, sigma/equality, mu, nu, Prop-bracket and impredicative-Set-bracket) in \"The Rooster and the Syntactic Bracket\".\n\n- My understanding of Jason's suggestion is then that the conversion of \"I params args\" and \"I' params' args'\" is to check I=I' and args=args' as usual but, then, instead of checking params=params', to check that the types of constructors are the same after instantiation of the params and normalization of these types.\n\n- This has obviously an extra cost in term of efficiency, though probably controllable.\n\nThen a possible strategy could be to implement this variant of conversion by default so as to globally improve the user experience without having him/her to be aware of the underlying subtlety. To minimize the extra cost, we could e.g. precompute in advance when the instantiation of params may create redexes in the type of constructors. I guess this kind of situation is rare (e.g. \"sig\" is not like this, only Jason's \"foo\" is so in the report) so the extra cost penalty would certainly be peanut in practice.\n\nBut maybe the first question is to understand more precisely what this kind of extension would give in practice.

Essentially, we would like to write inductive types with irrelevant parameters. As of today, it is possible to emulate it for non recursive types by using an intermediate definition, for instance:\n\nInductive unit_ := tt.\nDefinition unit (p : ℙ) := unit_.\n\nBut you can't do that for recursive types if the p argument is used somewhere in the constructor but not in the type. For instance, you have to put p in the parameters in the case of:\n\nInductive foo_ (p : ℙ) := Foo_ : (forall q ≤ p, foo_ q) -> foo_ p.\n\neven though the structure of foo_ does not depend on p.\n\nIntuitively, this is because inductive types are not first-class, you can only define them at toplevel. Parameters then behave like a restricted form of λ-abstraction. If you had first-class inductive types, you could get rid of parameters altogether by defining them as [fun param => μX : index -> Type. F X] with F a positive functor. In particular, you would get the reduction rules asked by Jason.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550412","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5293#issuecomment-337550412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5293","id":337550412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MDQxMg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T06:21:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T17:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\r\n\r\n> My understanding of Jason's suggestion is then that the conversion of\r\n> \"I params args\" and \"I' params' args'\" is to check I=I' and args=args' as \r\n> usual but, then, instead of checking params=params', to check that the types \r\n> of constructors are the same after instantiation of the params and \r\n> normalization of these types.\r\n\r\nNo, I want it to check I=I', and then instead of checking args=args' and params=params', I want it to check \"that the types of constructors are the same after instantiation of the params [and args] and normalization of these types.\"\r\n\r\n> I don't see at once how it impacts the intensional equality of [1 → Cᵒᵖ] and\r\n> [(1 → C)ᵒᵖ] (or writing translations such as forcing).\r\n\r\nAlone, it doesn't.

For instance, if `s` and `s'` are variables of sort with `A:s`, `B:s'`, is `A -> B` of some algebraic type `if s'=SProp or s'=Prop then s' else max(s,s')`? Or is such parametric sort of a type presented extensionally as an input/output function of the form `[SProp ↦ SProp; Prop ↦ Prop; Type(α) ↦ max (s, α)]`?
