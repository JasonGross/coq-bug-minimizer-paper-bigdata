It's unclear to me which is the desired behavior (though the \"This record contains fields of different records\" message is definitely wrong), but I'm leaning towards \"no error message, for both `Instance` and `Definition`, but, in any case, if trunk behaves differently from 8.4, this should be documented in CHANGES.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337526311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337526315","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3749#issuecomment-337526315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3749","id":337526315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyNjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-15T12:14:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:37:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
