If you want to compile e.g. a plugin so that it is compatible with Coq 8.11.2, the best way is to use the build script we use to compile the installer. This script sets up a fresh cygwin in a path you can configure, compiles Coq and everything and leaves you in this cygwin a build system which is at least good enough to compile Coq and all delivered plugins. The only manual work with this is that you have to give the options to this script.\r\n\r\nSo the procedure is (in a command shell with git ready or do the git otherwise and just CD to the coq folder)\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/coq/coq.git\r\ncd coq\r\ngit checkout V8.11.2    <<<< This is important to get exactly the same ocaml and everything as in 8.11.2\r\ncd dev/build/windows\r\n\r\ndownload cygwin 64 bit setup and put it into this folder e.g.\r\npowershell -Command \"(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe', 'setup-x86_64.exe')\"\r\n\r\n  SET EXTRA_ADDONS=^\r\n    -addon=bignums ^\r\n    -addon=equations ^\r\n    -addon=mtac2 ^\r\n    -addon=mathcomp ^\r\n    -addon=menhir ^\r\n    -addon=compcert ^\r\n    -addon=extlib ^\r\n    -addon=quickchick ^\r\n    -addon=coquelicot ^\r\n    -addon=vst ^\r\n    -addon=aactactics ^\r\n    -addon=flocq ^\r\n    -addon=interval ^\r\n    -addon=gappa_tool ^\r\n    -addon=gappa\r\n\r\nMakeCoq_MinGW.bat -threads=16 ^\r\n  -arch=64 -installer=N -coqver=\"/cygdrive/c/<your coq root folder with / slashes> ^\r\n  -destcyg=<your cygwin destination folder (Windows)> ^\r\n  -destcoq=<your coq destination folder in windows format (Windows)> \r\n  -cygcache=<your local cygwin cache folder> ^\r\n  %EXTRA_ADDONS% ^\r\n  -setup setup-x86_64.exe\r\n```\r\n(I hope I cut and pasted this correctly)\r\n\r\nThe cygwin repo we use recently has hickups. In case you have issues with this, give a different one with the -cygrepo=url option from here: (https://cygwin.com/mirrors.html)\r\n\r\nThere are also command line options to install Coq inside of the cygwin rather than in a separate folder. See the Readme.txt in the same folder as the batch file. If you install to a separate folder it is easier to zip and give to someone else.\r\n\r\nSorry for the messy command line - historic reasons - I am working on a new one right now (opam based, will come soon).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/655105906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/655116355","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10921#issuecomment-655116355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/10921","id":655116355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTExNjM1NQ==","user":{"login":"andrew-appel","id":9196811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTY4MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9196811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel","html_url":"https://github.com/andrew-appel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-appel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T20:33:41Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T20:33:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was just trying to compile metacoq, which is indeed a plugin.
