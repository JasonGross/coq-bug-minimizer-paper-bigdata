Many of these issues have been fixed (see e.g. #1006 and #984), and that allowed us to enable primitive projections at least for some parts of Iris. There are still issues related to `simpl` (#5708) and ssr's rewrite (#5699), and probably more to come. I believe such issues need to be fixed before we ship a standard library with primitive projections enabled by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/358926643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/365970925","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6609#issuecomment-365970925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6609","id":365970925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTk3MDkyNQ==","user":{"login":"anton-trunov","id":2316541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov","html_url":"https://github.com/anton-trunov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anton-trunov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-15T15:55:51Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T15:55:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#3301 seems to be closely related to this issue","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/365970925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/367055378","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6609#issuecomment-367055378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6609","id":367055378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzA1NTM3OA==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T17:33:41Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T17:33:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'd really like to see this in 8.8.
