What would be the type of `f` and `g`?
Either `A -> Type`, `A -> Set`, or `A -> Prop`.
Oh, I see, this is based on this [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51507117/extensionally-equal-predicates-and-equality-of-universally-quantified-applicatio). Thanks!

Extending the diagram of the relative axiom strength would be nice too.
Indeed, that would be useful. Would one of you like to do it?

While we are discussing this, in the series of axioms to add, one should also add the so-called "extensional axiom of choice", or "setoid choice", i.e. [choice](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/theories/Logic/SetoidChoice.v) up to an arbitrary equivalence relation.

One should probably also add to the wiki and the library the strengthening of Berardi's paradox mentioned last June on the [TYPES list](http://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2018/002048.html) by Dominik Kirst.
