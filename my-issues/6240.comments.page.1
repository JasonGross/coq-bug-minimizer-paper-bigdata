I think the thing that's happening is that the old states are not being marked as invalid, so when the profiler filters its list of states it's seen for only the valid ones, the ones backtracked across are not getting dropped.  If this boolean previously invalidated states when `false` (when emacs-mode was true), and it stopped invalidating states on non-batch-mode (which is what corresponds roughly to emacs-like), this would account for the problem.
