Fixing this may cause backwards incompatibility (unlikely, but should be noted), but I don't see how this is anything other than a bug.  (Luckily, it seems like it only happens in this one case, where one notation shadows a definition of the same name.)\n\nModule Import A1. Definition nd1 := Set. End A1.\nModule Import B1.
