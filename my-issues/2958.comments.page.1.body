I've been told (https://github.com/HoTT/coq/issues/3) that the following code generates "Error: There is an inductive name deep in a "in" clause." in the trunk version coq; it executes fine in v8.4:

Require Import Omega.
Theorem foo : forall (n m : nat) (pf : n = m),
                match pf in _ = N with 
                  | eq_refl => unit
                end.
