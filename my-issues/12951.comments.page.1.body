For what is worth, we had the same kind of issue with Why3. So, we solved it by checking not only that `ocamlfind query zarith` succeeds, but also that the resulting directory contains both `zarith.cma` and `z.cmi`. The latter file is provided by `libzarith-ocaml-dev`.
You might also use the debian package for coq 8.12.0 which is currently in debian experimental (I cannot upload it to unstable ATM since why3 depends on coq 8.11.0).  I suppose that you can just build the package on a recent ubuntu system, and it has all the dependencies on the necessary debian packages, including lablgtk3 stuff for building the IDE.
@treinen The issue is that the configure script is not picking up that `libzarith-ocaml-dev` is not installed. We (the HoTT library) were able to build the library on coq master fine, but initially `./configure` was incorrectly reporting that zarith was found even though we had only installed `libzarith-ocaml` rather than `libzarith-ocaml-dev`.

In summary, the coq configure script isn't checking for `libzarith-ocaml-dev` like it should.
