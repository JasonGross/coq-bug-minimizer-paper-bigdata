In Coq 8.5:
<prompt>Coq < 1 || 0 < </prompt>Axiom x : True.
<infomsg>
x is assumed</infomsg>


In Coq 8.4:

<prompt>Coq < 4 || 0 < </prompt>Axiom x : True.
x is assumed


The extra newline is definitely wrong, and I prefer the old coloring for the message (why was this changed?)

Fixed the extra newline, it is also not displayed as warning.

Thanks for reporting.
