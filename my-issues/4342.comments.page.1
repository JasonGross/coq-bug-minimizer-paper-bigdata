But in 8.5, it silently gives me the first obligation of [bar], which is of type [Foo -> True], because [foo] was implicitly generalized over.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337536480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1047102959","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4342#issuecomment-1047102959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4342","id":1047102959,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh84-aYXv","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-21T17:32:37Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T17:32:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seems to be fixed as of 302334cd0e3961a8476e8071ca4482318e0dce6f.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1047102959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
