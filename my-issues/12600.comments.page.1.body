@ppedrot Is this evar allocation or something else?
So, it's not so much evar allocation, but it's indeed indirectly due to the fact that the evar contexts are linear. The problem is that the old unification checks that a term is closed before deciding what to do (in `Unification.matchrec`), and rewrite relies on unification to apply the lemma. I had a patch somewhere that probably solved this problem which was even turned into a PR, but closed because no observable effect.

EDIT: this is #14253.
I confirm that #14253 solves the issue.
@ppedrot #14253 only fixed this when the rewriting lemma has no evars, right?
