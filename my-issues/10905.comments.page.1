Let me try to explain.\r\n\r\nIn coq_makefile 1 there are two ways to override, passing VAR=x to coq_makefile (or put it in _CoqProject) and passing the VAR=x to make on the command line.\r\n\r\nIn coq_makefile 2 you can override by putting VAR=x in Makefile.local or passing VAR=x it to make on the command line. For backward compatibility, since many _CoqProject file contain VAR=x, I did not remove that possibility, but I guess it never got tested for OTHEFLAGS (maybe there was no OTHERFLAGS=.. in the wild, pretty sure I saw stuff like COQC=.. and I guess it still works).\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think VAR=x does not belong to _CoqProject is that its *syntax* is specific to make, even the escaping rules for strings are. UIs are supposed to do something with this file, so the plan was to move all make specific code (including extra targets, see the deprecated -phony & co) to Makefile.local and leave in _CoqProject only Coq specific stuff (the list of files, the loadpath, extra command line arguments to enable features...)\r\n\r\nSo, unless there is a use can for still supporting VAR=x in _CoqProject or in the command line of coq_makefile, I believe we should avoid doing that and use the other override mechanisms.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/542563620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/827707668","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10905#issuecomment-827707668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/10905","id":827707668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNzcwNzY2OA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T15:39:40Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T15:39:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe the solution for `OTHERFLAGS` in particular is to use `-arg` in `_CoqProject`.
