Essentially, there are two classes of exceptions, the fatal ones and the other ones. Ltac never catches the former (otherwise, that'd be a bug).\n\nThe problem stems from exceptions from the second class that reach toplevel without having a handler. In that case, they are displayed to the user as an anomaly, e.g. the infamous \"Anomaly: Uncaught exception Not_found\". But internally, one cannot check whether it's legal for such an exception to be raised or if it's a stray one.
