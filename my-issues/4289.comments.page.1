author: @herbelin\n\nThe problem comes (in 8.5) from the compare and hash functions of user/canonical pairs of names (in Names.KerPair), in combination with backtracking.\n\nMy understanding of the cause of the problem is the following:\n\nIn a given active \"logical\" environment, two equal user names implies that their canonical names are the same.\n\nHowever, since the hash table used for backtracking is not reset by backtracking, and since the counter for unique ident is not synchronous with backtracking, one can have pairs (user,canonical) of a logical session which collide with pairs (user,canonical') from a previous logical session overwritten by backtracking which remains in the hash table.\n\nI see several alternatives possible:\n\n1 don't try to optimize the hash-consing time and use the canonical part also for hash-consing\n2 make the hash-consing table synchronous with backtracking\n3 make the uniq ident synchronous with backtracking.\n\nWhat the hash-consing experts think?\n\nIf I would implement it myself, I would do 1 by simplicity, but maybe 2 would be more \"moral\" (i.e. why to keep in the hashtable objects which do not belong any more to the current active \"logical\" environment)\n\nIn particular, I will push 1 for branch v8.4, but I'm unsure for

Two kernel pairs are equal if their canonical parts are (see KerPair.equal), but they are hash-consed to the same value if their user parts are equal (see KerPair.Self_Hashcons.equal). So my initial move would simply be to fix KerPair.Self_Hashcons so that it is consistent with KerPair.equal. That would make your solution 1 irrelevant (or rather implicitly implemented).\n\nAs for solution 2, it mostly depends on how often the hashconsing table is purged. If it happens regularly, no need to degrade performances by tying the table to the backtracking mechanism.\n\nNow, for the longer term. Let us imagine that one day, we get to the bright new land where computations happen concurrently inside the kernel. In particular, there might be computations working with obsolete data. That is expected, and not an issue, as long as their side effects cannot affect computations with up-to-date data. This means that solution 3 is plain wrong. It also makes solution 1 mandatory (see above anyway).

That is just a bullet waiting for a foot. As soon as someone introduces some global cache (to avoid expensive computations), even if you backtrack the cache, since you have obsolete computations on flight, the content of your cache becomes incorrect. Example:\n\n- define D\n- do some computation about definition D\n- nothing in the cache yet, so start a full computation\n- keep computing\n- backtrack before D is defined, including the cache\n- keep computing\n- define D, with the same unique identifiers because of solution 3\n- keep computing\n- finish computation and store the result in the cache\n- return the result, it will be discarded because it is obsolete\n- do some computation about definition D\n- find something in the cache, because identifiers are no longer unique\n- return the content of the cache\n- fail badly\n\nSure, it could be made to work by not storing anything in the cache if some backtrack happened since the start of the computation. But the foolproof way is just to ensure that no two definitions share the same unique identifier. That is why I said that solution 3 is not suitable for a concurrent setting.\n\nFor the record, Why3 is already using weak tables for hashconsing, with the behavior you are describing. Ephemerons are not needed at all (though they would make the implementation much simpler). I am not sure I could explain where the miracle comes from, as the implementation is quite tricky (something about storing tables inside values rather than the opposite).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535622","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4289#issuecomment-337535622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4289","id":337535622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzNTYyMg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T16:31:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nOK for solution 1 but I'm unsure of what we each other intend. In particular,  two kernel pairs are equal (in the sense of CIC conversion) if their canonical parts are (in the syntactic sense), but this does not mean that two kernel names with same canonical name can be syntactically (and physically) identified. In particular, KerPair.equal is not used for hash-consing, as far as I can see (see HMap.Make which requires only compare and hash).\n\nIn any case, agreed that solution 2 is a priori costly (though keeping obsolete data in the hash-consing table also has a cost, which at some time in the past\nhappened to have been significant).\n\nAs for solution 3, I'm unsure I fully understood the point. I thought \nGuillaume was considering evaluating several disjoint \"Module M(A:S).\" in\nparallel with ability for locally undoing each of this\nevaluation (say à la Alf) rather than backtracking along a linear\nsequence of commands as it is now. In this case, either the counter\nwould have needed to be fully global (and \"infinite\" enough), or, better,\nmade more local (i.e. made local to each \"Module\" declaration; I don't\nknow for sure why the counter has been introduced by Jacek but I guess\nit is to deal with configuration like \"Module M(A:S). Module Sub(A:T).\").\n\nBut maybe you actually meant something else.\n\nAnyway, let's go for solution 1, as I did for 8.4, i.e. not trying to mix the logical level and the physical level, i.e. considering pairs of kernel names as purely syntactic blocks to be dealt syntactically and renouncing to mix it with logical arguments which are valid only in a consistent environment (while the memory has no reason to contain objects from a single consistent environment, as the residual objects after backtracking shows).\n\nIn short, unless no further objection, I'll commit hash-consing of pairs of kernel names along a purely syntactical way.\n\n[A long-term solution where the counter is local to a functor declaration might\nbe cleaner (no more side-effect), but that's another story, part\nof the general question of the status of modules in the kernel.]\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535624","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4289#issuecomment-337535624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4289","id":337535624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzNTYyNA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T12:02:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nI applied a patch (9f81b585519) which changes KerPair.hash/KerPair.Self_Hashcons.hash and KerPair.Self_Hashcons.equal (both used in HashKP.hcons, hence hcons_con).\n\nI found this code pretty difficult to follow, with variants of equal functions used for different purposes.
