Until Coq gets proper namespaces, I've found \nthat a good way to organize things is to have a folder A/, with a bunch of \nfiles, and then have a file A.v which [Include]s all of those files.  This \nallows parallel compilation while having everything in a shared namespace, \nwithout having to recreate the directory structure in modules in every file.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337533112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345510875","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4135#issuecomment-345510875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4135","id":345510875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTUxMDg3NQ==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-19T11:53:59Z","updated_at":"2017-11-19T11:53:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JasonGross the aux files have a natural filename component so you should probably use those instead of parsing interactive output.\r\nSo I suggest we WONTFIX this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345510875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
