Here in this bug, the decompose_app provides no args since the type of \"test\" starts with some products. I attach a temptative patch that starts with a decompose_prod and then tries to build a correct env for the reduction test.\n\nAlas, this is not the end of the story. After this patch, I get on the precise example the following error:\n<<\nError: Cannot refine with term\n \"JMeq_ind_r (fun _ : nat => forall n m : nat, JMeq n m) \n    ?237 (test ?232 ?233)\" because a metavariable has several occurrences.\n>>\nHas it something to see with the fact that the goal is still quantified ?\nAfter all, a regular rewrite would fail too (albeit with a less scary error).\n\nIf I try \"intros. rewrite test.\" the error is now\n<<\nError: Unable to find an instance for the variable m.\n>>\nOnce again, this looks legitimate: \"rewrite\" cannot read minds...\n\nFinally, a \"intros. rewrite (test n m).\" seems to work ok.\n\nHugo or Matthieu, could you please check whether my patch is ok and whether the above errors are legitimate ?\n\nThanks,\nPierre\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511207","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/2837#issuecomment-337511207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/2837","id":337511207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxMTIwNw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-10T09:14:20Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T08:54:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @letouzey\n\n\nPatch ok with Hugo, applied as r16392 (trunk) and r16393 (v8.4)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
