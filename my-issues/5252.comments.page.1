However, changing the type \nof [eq_rect] would break compatibility for anything that mentions [eq_rect] \nexplicitly, so I've given this the milestone next 8.x.  Perhaps there's another \nway to fix it that involves modifying the [induction] tactic.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
