Indeed, tactics should never produce an inconsistent set of constraints. This is the duty of tactics to preserve this invariant; hence I close this bug!\n\n(And well, you still have the workaround you mentioned).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337523327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
