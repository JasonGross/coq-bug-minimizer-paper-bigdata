Require Foo.

Extraction "Foo" Foo.
(* Error: Extraction of file Foo.v as a module is asked.
Monolithic Extraction cannot deal with this situation.
Please extract some objects of this module or
use (Recursive) Extraction Library instead. *)


This can't be hard to implement, though, because the following works fine:

Require Foo.

Module Bar.
  Include Foo.
End Bar.

Extraction "Foo" Bar.
