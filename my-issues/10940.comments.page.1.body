@ppedrot Do you intend to address this in time for 8.12? If that's the case, there should be an assignee. If not, please remove or adjust the milestone.
This is not urgent, so postponing.
This was already postponed once. Not a problem, but maybe the milestone could be simply removed?
Having access to the number of parameters of an Inductive would be a useful feature!
Lack of this feature in Ltac 1 made me come up with hacks [like this one](https://github.com/mit-plv/bedrock2/blob/720023ddce9ba114f451cf3f0ebc8f9ee3002893/compiler/src/compiler/Simp.v#L44-L82), where I derive the number of parameters by checking for how many arguments passed to a constructor, the induction principle can be specialized with the argument (which is only the case for parameters, but not for indices).
@ppedrot I'd like an update w.r.t. this PR and its milestone
It's an issue, not a PR, so postpone.
My interpretation of milestoned issues, is that they have something to do with that release. So I'm not postponing, but rather clearing the milestone.
