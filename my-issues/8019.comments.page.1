Let me draw a diagram.\r\n\r\n```\r\n     1          2                 3           4\r\nCoq ---> OCaml ---> machine code ---> value <---> Coq\r\n```\r\nWhen invoking native compilation, the phases involved are:\r\n1. Transpiling of Coq code to OCaml code\r\n2. Compilation of OCaml to machine code\r\n3. Evaluation of that code\r\n4. Reification\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is quite fast, at least I usually do not observe it on real examples, and its time is a function of the size of the provided Coq term. Phase 2 is slow, and depends on the size of the generated OCaml code (and thus of the original Coq code). This constitutes the *static* part of native compilation, although the boundaries are a bit blurry in Coq.\r\n\r\nPhase 3 and 4 are the runtime parts of native compilation. Phase 3 is arbitrarily complex in time, and phase 4 can recursively call phase 3 when operating over open terms.\r\n\r\nIn the VM, phases 1 and 2 are morally merged together. The main difference is that VM(1+2) is of the same order of complexity as native(1), but native(2) is costly because the OCaml compiler is too clever for its own good. Amongst other things, it uses full blown parsing, typing, intermediate compilation, optimization and machine code generation. The typical code generated by the native compiler puts a heavy load on the register allocation algorithm, and ends up taking most of its time in there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/405110923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/405650097","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8019#issuecomment-405650097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8019","id":405650097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTY1MDA5Nw==","user":{"login":"maximedenes","id":647105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/647105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes","html_url":"https://github.com/maximedenes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximedenes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T16:47:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T16:47:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ppedrot and I have been investigating this very closely today, and there is something suspicious that we could not figure out yet.
