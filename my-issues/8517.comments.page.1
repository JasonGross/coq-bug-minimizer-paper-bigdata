Are some \"indiscretion\" already possible or do we have to wait? In particular, I'm very curious about how it shall compare to `Equations` and the various variants of `Scheme`/`Derive` in terms of supported schemes, supported types, etc. Apparently, efficiency shall be good and I guess it is less painful methodology than working directly with de Bruijn indices (as in `indrec.ml` or `eqschemes.ml`), while at the same time more controlled than working with tactics (as in `auto_ind_decl.ml`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/423741879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/437635462","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8517#issuecomment-437635462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8517","id":437635462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzYzNTQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T01:19:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T01:19:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It should be possible to construct equality schemes + proofs that are linear in the number of constructors.  Taking inspiration from https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/8965#discussion_r232454555, it should be possible to encode constructor indices as n-tuples of booleans, and encode constructor data as dependent over the index type.  Then you can prove that the sigma of the index and the data is equivalent to the original type, and transport any boolean/decidable equality across the equivalence.  Since the encoded index type uses log(n) space, it should be possible to write the decider for the indexed part in (log(n))^2 space, and then write the decider for the data part in linear space, giving terms that are overall linear in the number of constructors.
