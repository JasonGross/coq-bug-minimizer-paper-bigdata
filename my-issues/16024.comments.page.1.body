I think I know precisely why this one is failing. I believe I've spotted this bug last time I messed with the module system but didn't care to report it (for fear of having to fix it).
simplified
~~~coq
Module Type T. End T.

Module F (E : T) := E.

Module Type FT (X:T). End FT.

Module M := F <+ FT.
