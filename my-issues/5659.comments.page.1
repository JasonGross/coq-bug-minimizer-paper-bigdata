author: @JasonGross\n\nI would like the following to work:\n\nGoal exists x, x = 5 + 5.\nProof.\n  eexists.\n  vm_compute.\n  reflexivity.\n\nCurrently, I have to do a work-around like this:\n\nGoal exists x, x = 5 + 5.\nProof.\n  eexists.\n  lazymatch goal with\n  | [ |- ?e = ?v ]\n    => let v' := (eval vm_compute in v) in\n       unify e v';\n         vm_cast_no_check (eq_refl v')\n  end.\n\nThis is annoying, and I wonder if the call to unify introduces overhead when \nthe context or the goal is extremely large.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337555965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337555966","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5659#issuecomment-337555966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5659","id":337555966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NTk2Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-30T17:02:54Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:09:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
