(* confusing : False *)\n\nIt would be nice if there was a flag (maybe \"Set Strict Checking.\" or \"Set Strict Evars.\" or something) which caused [Check confusing.] to error with \"Error: Cannot infer the implicit parameter x of confusing.\" or, if it's easier just to pass the resulting term through the machinery of [has_evar], something like \"Error: confusing as an uninstantiated evar.  Try [Set Printing All.  Unset Strict Checking.] to see where the evar ?1 is located.\"  I'd expect the flags to have a similar effect on [Eval ... in confusing.]\n\nI don't care much what the default behavior of [Check] and [Eval] are, so long as the behavior where they permit uninstantiated evars is still accessible.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337514640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/379247271","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3046#issuecomment-379247271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3046","id":379247271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTI0NzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T13:06:02Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T13:06:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nowadays it prints the list of undefined evars, I think that's enough to make it non-misleading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/379247271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
