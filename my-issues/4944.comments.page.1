My commit message explains how it works:\n\nOn the user side, coqtop and coqc take a list of warning names or categories after -w. No prefix means activate the warning, a \"-\" prefix means deactivate it, and \"+\" means turn the warning into an error. Special categories include \"all\", and \"default\" which contains the warnings enabled by default.\n    \nWe also provide a vernacular Set Warnings which takes the same flags as argument.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545259","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4944#issuecomment-337545259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4944","id":337545259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NTI1OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T17:46:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:34:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nIt took me a while to figure out that [Set Warnings] takes a string.\n\nWould it make sense to provide a variant of [Set Warnings] that gave different behavior in interactive vs non-interactive mode?
