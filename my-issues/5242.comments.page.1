It is \nannoying enough that to use COQPATH, I must have a directory whose logical name \nand physical name match which contains my development.  It seems absurd to \nadditionally require that there be no other directories in the parent \ndirectory.  At the very least, it should be possible to silence this warning.  \nProbably, the warning should either not exist, or be silenced by default, as in \n8.5.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549753","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5242#issuecomment-337549753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5242","id":337549753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0OTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-02T14:52:03Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:49:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @maximedenes\n\nFixed in v8.6 branch.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549754","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5242#issuecomment-337549754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5242","id":337549754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0OTc1NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-02T17:06:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:49:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nThanks!\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337549754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
