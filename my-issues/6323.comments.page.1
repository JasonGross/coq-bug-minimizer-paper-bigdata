sorry about that, the Jenkins CI that alerted me of this build failure seems to lag behind github a few days.  It build fine with the version of master the CI was running on Dec 1, and I wasn't careful enough and swapped the build date of successful fiat-crypto (Dec 1) with the nearest pull date of Coq master (Dec 2).  The pull of Coq on Nov 28 didn't build, so it was actually running Coq from Nov 25.  Lesson learned: Always go by the Coq commit versions the scripts print out, not by dates.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/349405052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/349407576","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6323#issuecomment-349407576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6323","id":349407576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTQwNzU3Ng==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-05T19:05:52Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T19:05:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have possible fix, building stdlib / test suite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/349407576/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
