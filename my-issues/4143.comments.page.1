Use \"dintuition\" for compatibility.\n\nFrom the CHANGES:\n\n- Tactic \"tauto\" was exceptionally able to destruct other connectives\n  than the binary connectives \"and\", \"or\", \"prod\", \"sum\", \"iff\". This\n  non-uniform behavior has been fixed (bug [BZ#2680](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%232680%22)) and tauto is\n  slightly weaker (possible source of incompatibilities). On the\n  opposite side, new tactic \"dtauto\" is able to destruct any\n  record-like inductive types, superseding the old version of \"tauto\".\n- Similarly, \"intuition\" has been made more uniform and, where it now\n  fails, \"dintuition\" can be used (possible source of incompatibilities).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337533313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
