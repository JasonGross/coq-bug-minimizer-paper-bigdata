I'd need numerous calls to `constr_eq` (or Ltac's `context`) to check whether or not progress was made, because `cbv delta [foo bar]` will unfold both `foo` and `bar` regardless of whether or not one is defined in terms of the other (unlike `cbv delta [foo]; cbv delta [bar]`).  And I'd need to first issue all the `cbv delta` calls, followed by a single call to `cbv beta iota zeta`, and hope that the term I get by running a lot of `cbv delta` isn't too big.... The underlying issue here, in some sense, is that there's no way to build `cbv [foo bar]` from `cbv [foo]` and `cbv [bar]` without sacrificing a lot in performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/344536322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345535059","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6144#issuecomment-345535059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6144","id":345535059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTUzNTA1OQ==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-19T17:41:23Z","updated_at":"2017-11-19T17:41:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JasonGross Already accessible in the Ltac2 API btw.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345535059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
