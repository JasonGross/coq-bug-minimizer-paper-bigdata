Goal False.
Proof.
  pose True as F.
  let c := constr:(I : F) in
  clear F; pose False as F;
    pose proof c.
  assumption.
Defined.
(* Error:
In environment
F := True : Prop
F0 := False : Prop
The term "I" has type "True" while it is expected to have type "F0". *)

I'd prefer if any fix for this doesn't incur an time overhead on [pose] / [pose 
proof]


Doing evil with `clear` and ltac bindings is already reported in a bunc of other places.
