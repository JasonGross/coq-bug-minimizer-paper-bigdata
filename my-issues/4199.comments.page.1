Right now dependent destruction is based on generalizing the goal by heterogeneous equalities, so it would make the tactic fail most of the time with this flag, but if you're interested you could redefine the tactic\n[simplify_one_dep_elim_term] to fail or introduce an heterogeneous equality instead of simplifying it (first case of simplify_one_dep_elim_term), or do a trick like in HoTT, requiring a typeclass instance of the axiom.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337534201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
