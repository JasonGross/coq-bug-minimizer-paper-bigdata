you have `t : constr = fun x : T => x` then `kind_of_term t` will be `Lambda (x,T, unbound rel 1)` because the body needs to be considered in the extended context.\r\n\r\nIn the example given by @herbelin `Eval cbv beta in (fun x => _) 0.` we will end up in the LAM/APP case of `cbv_stack_value` with `b = ?X@{x:=Rel 1}` and `args = [| 0 |]` and empty `stk`. So we go into `cbv_stack_term` with the extended `env`. At this point everything is fine.\r\nThe first step of `cbv_stack_term` is `norm_head`. We are in the Evar case with an undefined evar, so we return `VAL (0, ?X@{x:=Rel 1}), TOP` (TOP because empty stack).\r\nThen we apply `cbv_stack_value` on the result. For `VAL/TOP` it just returns the VAL above.\r\nAt this point we are done with operations under the extended environment and have an unbound rel.\r\n\r\nIf we liken evars to applications it seems a `cbv_stack_term` is missing in the undefined evar case. The following patch adds it and makes both @herbelin's `Eval cbv ...` and the original report go through. I may have misunderstood something though (eg I had a first version passing `stack` which is definitively wrong).\r\n``` ocaml\r\n--- a/pretyping/cbv.ml\r\n+++ b/pretyping/cbv.ml\r\n@@ -290,7 +290,14 @@ let rec norm_head info env t stack =\r\n   | Evar ev ->\r\n       (match evar_value info.infos.i_cache ev with\r\n           Some c -> norm_head info env c stack\r\n-        | None -> (VAL(0, t), stack))\r\n+        | None ->\r\n+          let e, xs = ev in\r\n+          let xs' = Array.map (fun x ->\r\n+              let v = cbv_stack_term info TOP env x in\r\n+              reify_value v)\r\n+              xs\r\n+          in\r\n+          (VAL(0, mkEvar (e,xs')), stack))\r\n \r\n   (* non-neutral cases *)\r\n   | Lambda _ ->\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/339423691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/339439194","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5761#issuecomment-339439194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5761","id":339439194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTQzOTE5NA==","user":{"login":"psteckler","id":2244648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler","html_url":"https://github.com/psteckler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T19:11:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T19:11:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can confirm the fix for @herbelin's example and the original bug report. @SkySkimmer do you want to make a PR (or I can do that)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/339439194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/339449628","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5761#issuecomment-339449628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5761","id":339449628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTQ0OTYyOA==","user":{"login":"psteckler","id":2244648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler","html_url":"https://github.com/psteckler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T19:48:27Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T19:48:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Incidentally, the change does not fix #6016.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/339449628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
