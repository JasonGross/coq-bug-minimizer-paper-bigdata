author: @andersk\n\nIt is indeed true that coq.inria.fr is an alias (CNAME) for www.lix.polytechnique.fr, and the server has a certificate that’s valid for www.lix.polytechnique.fr.\n\nHowever, since DNSSEC is not widely deployed (and inria.fr has no DNSSEC signatures anyway), it would be quite easy for an attacker to spoof DNS responses to make it look like coq.inria.fr is an alias for evilattacker.biz, which points to a server with a certificate that’s valid for evilattacker.biz.  They could then replace displayed content, steal user passwords, etc.\n\nThere is no way that browsers could tell the difference between these two scenarios, which is why browsers are not allowed to take DNS aliases into account when validating certificates.  See RFC 2818.  All major browsers (not just Chrome) present this situation as a certificate mismatch, and they are correct to do so.\n\nThe server needs to be fixed to send a certificate that’s valid for coq.inria.fr.
