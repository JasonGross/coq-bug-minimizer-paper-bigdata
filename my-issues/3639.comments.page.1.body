Goal True -> True.
  intro H.
  Fail let x := H in fail 0 x. (* Error: Tactic failure: H. *)
  Fail fail 0 H. (* Error: Error: H not found. *)

This has always been the behaviour as far as I'm aware. The "message" part of idtac and fail take a list of ltac identifiers which unfold to integers or terms (can also be integer and string literals).

IÂ don't think it's bound to change, so I'll close this request.
