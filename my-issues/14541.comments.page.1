Is it for compatibility reasons with internal parts of Coq dealing with kernel names? In particular , why not to have it as the alias `A.B.C` (in the nametab) of a unique-by-construction absolute (i.e. `MPFile`-like) name (say `F.A.B.C` if the module declaration is in file `F.v`)?\r\n\r\nIf an alias is enough, a possible way to implement them would be to register the alias to `Declaremods.start_module`/`Lib.start_mod` (in addition to the absolute name !lib_state.path_prefix.Nametab.obj_dir) and to do so that each new object put in the module comes with an alias of same prefix (to be done at the `load`/`open` time of each individual named declaration of the module).\r\n\r\nNamespaces were actually discussed at the call today. @ppedrot said he has ideas on how to implement them. There is also the [cep](https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/25#issuecomment-723988445). On my side, it is not clear whether modules are not enough to simulate namespaces but I'm also ok to have a secondary notion of container distinct from modules. In any case, @ppedrot and @gares, what can we do to help you in this direction (and in particular, what can I do with #14492)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/867135084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/867161692","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14541#issuecomment-867161692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14541","id":867161692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzE2MTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T21:10:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T21:10:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The motivation here is a bit different from that of namespaces, even if the features overlap.

But handling multiple files is an enormous increase in complexity.  At a minimum, I'd have to handle the following:\r\n- having two copies of the dependent file, one for producing the .vo associated with the coqc that should succeed, and another for the coqc that should fail\r\n- somehow convincing coqc to load my version of the file rather than the one from the original development, ideally without breaking the contract that the minimizer doesn't change .v files in your development.  Note that the original development still needs to be bound for the other Requires to work.  I suppose I could copy the entire development tree to a new location, and operate on that in place, but this is still moderately more complex (and fails pretty badly if the minimizer is also trying to inline things from user-contrib, which it generally is).\r\n\r\nIf it's not too complicated to add an attribute that allows setting the unshadowable absolute name, I'd very much appreciate that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/867183404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/867184724","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14541#issuecomment-867184724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14541","id":867184724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzE4NDcyNA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T21:50:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T21:50:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note
