I maintain that this should be a proper error message with a line number which does not crash coqtop (and that if the worker binary does not exist then the error message should mention the binary it tried to execute).  Given that even `assert false` branches only lead to anomalies and not crashes, I think this is not too much to ask.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/498297341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/498299035","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10281#issuecomment-498299035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/10281","id":498299035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODI5OTAzNQ==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T15:12:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T15:12:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

think the issue has little to do with `par:`, I guess you get a similar failure with `coqc -asyn-proofs on`.
