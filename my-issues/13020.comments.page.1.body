It seems that the spaces disappeared during the translation of the reference manual to sphinx. Maybe because the person who translated did not see a use of them, since, indeed, one space is inserted anyway on both sides of the bar.

There is a heuristic starting at line 330 of [`metasyntax.ml`](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/282bf5806ca861ca7649bdd8555cba2b2130a3d7/vernac/metasyntax.ml#L330) which would be tedious to document.

I'm making a fix for the refman (#13022).
