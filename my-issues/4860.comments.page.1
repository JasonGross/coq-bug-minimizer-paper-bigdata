If A is an arity of some sort and s is a sort, we write A/s for the arity obtained from A by replacing its sort with s. Especially, if A is well-typed in some global environment and local context, then A/s is typable by typability of all products in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. The following typing rule is added to the theory.\n\nThere are some examples further down, but you wouldn't know that these are examples of sort-polymorphism without already knowing what it is; they're under the \"Ind-Family\" section.  The examples should have a clear heading, or be joined with the sort-polymorphism heading, and this section should be linked to from (or included in) the chapter on full universe polymorphism, which doesn't even allude to sort-polymorphism.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337544277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/470099806","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4860#issuecomment-470099806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4860","id":470099806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDA5OTgwNg==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T13:05:52Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T13:05:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's a TODO for after a decision is taken on the future of template polymorphism (which I hope will be soon).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/470099806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/930340333","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4860#issuecomment-930340333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4860","id":930340333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh843c93t","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-29T16:32:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T16:32:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's more doc on template poly these days I think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/930340333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/931217425","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4860#issuecomment-931217425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4860","id":931217425,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh843gUAR","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T11:00:41Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T11:00:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Where?
