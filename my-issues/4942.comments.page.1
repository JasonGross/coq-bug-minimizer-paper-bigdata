Why is this invalid?  You're saying that in order to build any development whatsoever on Windows, without getting a few dozen warning messages per file, I have to disable all warnings?  This seems like an unreasonable penalty to Windows users.  Either don't forward the warning (I've never had any trouble with such paths, anyway), or make it possible to silence only this warning.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337545240","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4942#issuecomment-337545240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4942","id":337545240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NTI0MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T13:18:20Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:34:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @maximedenes\n\nSorry, this bug was specifically about the lack of configurability.
