The type \"open_constr_wTC\" is buggy: when an open_constr is pretyped, no TC resolution should happen.  Given that the fix was introduced in a pl release, we did not want to break things with no remedy, hence a way to access the bug.\n\nI'm no expert, but looking at the code it seems sufficient to give a type\nconstraint to the open_constr to force the TC resolution (like putting it inside a cast).
