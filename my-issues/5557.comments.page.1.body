I think the checker should accept -indices-matter, and the behavior of 
-indices-matter should be that it enforces -indices-matter on all inductive 
types in the passed files.


Seems to have been fixed by #8986.
@ppedrot Did you check if coqchk actually does anything with it however?
AFAIK coqchk works with indices matter no problems but just to be sure.
It sets the flag in Safe_typing, so yes this should work properly.
