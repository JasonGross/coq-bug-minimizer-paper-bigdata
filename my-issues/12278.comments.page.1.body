Very strangely, if I insert calls to `ltac1:(optimize_heap)` before each of the `Control.time` calls, that does smooth out the curve, but it does it by *increasing* the amount of time the call takes (e.g., the user time for `refine` on 7400 jumps from 4.961s to 11.152s.......
Ah, but if I insert `optimize_heap` just before each loop, then the timing discrepencies go away, and there is not a big jump (in fact `refine` gets faster).  As suggested by @Blaisorblade at https://gitter.im/coq/coq?at=5eb47b87347bd61630607bef, it's probably because GC is thrashing the cache at inopportune times.  So I will consider this question resolved.
