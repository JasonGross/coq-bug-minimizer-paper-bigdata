The issue is basically that the algorithm for resolving [Import] and [Export] depends on whether or not the name given is an absolute name or not.  This means that inlining files changes the behavior of [Import], because there is no longer a way to give them the required absolute name.\n\nI would therefore like to request the following feature: a [ModuleDirectory SomeName.  ... End SomeName.] vernacular which opens a directory-like module: everything inside the [ModuleDirectory] is accessible as both [Foo] and [SomeName.Foo].  Importantly, [Import SomeName] should not consider the [ModuleDirectory] as a candidate for [Import].  Ideally, it should be possible to have multiple [ModuleDirectory] directives in the same file with the same name.  If it makes it easier to implement, I'm perfectly fine with disallowing any vernacular other than [ModuleDirectory], [Module], and [End] inside a [ModuleDirectory].\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
