The problems were:\n\n1.) A major requirement is that all sources going into the build can be collected and archived. The reason for this is to fullfill legal open source requirements for binary deliveries. GPL requires that you deliver the exact sources you used - no delegation or excuses allowed. Of cause only a small part is GPL but it is extremely tedious to find out what is licensed in which way (this can also change) so it is safest to just archive all sources. As long as something is \"university only\" nobody is too picky about this, but as soon as a tool gets used industrially, their might be people torpedizing it for some profit reason, and a hit in this direction might be quite a disaster. I don't see that opam does this in an organized way. E.g. my scripts have features to get the sources of cygwin MinGW target libraries going into the build (some of which are GPL). Also the OCaml build of opam e.g. used binary indelivieres - it maybe still does. \n\n2.) In order to be able to fix bugs later in specific versions, it is required for industrial users to be able to 100% reproduce a build later on - maybe years later. This also requires requirement 1.) above but also a few additional steps. E.g. the scripts also allows to archive the complete build environment (cygwin) used. The assumption is that the output of a MinGW build done on Cygwin does not depend on the specific windows version used - likely not 100% true because Windows DLLs are linked in - but I think as is it is good enough and going further gets tricky like archive an OS together with several specimens a HW on which it runs.\n\n3.) it was more effort to get opam build/install reliably with one script (I tested it over 6 months) then the few packages I need. Maybe this is better now.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554490","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5562#issuecomment-337554490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5562","id":337554490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NDQ5MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T15:18:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:04:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ejgallego\n\nDear Michael,\n\nthanks for your reply; regarding your requirements, I think I should point out that OPAM allows you to fulfill requirements 1 and 2 without much effort, recall that OPAM is a _source based_ package manager, and you can indeed specify exact configurations to build.

OPAM doesn't provide yet 100% reproducible builds, but so doesn't your scripts IIUC.\n\nA good point in favor of OPAM is that it usually works well for CI testing, it tends to be more reliable than hand-made scripts due to the dynamic nature of the OCaml ecosystem.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554492","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5562#issuecomment-337554492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5562","id":337554492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NDQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T15:19:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:04:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ejgallego\n\n[The relevant commands are `opam source` and `opam pin`]\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554494","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5562#issuecomment-337554494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5562","id":337554494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NDQ5NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T16:01:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:04:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @MSoegtropIMC\n\nDear Emilio,\n\nfor sure I can try it again. A lot of things have improved in the last 18 months. E.g. when I started it was not even possible to build OCAML from sources on Windows. There was a circular dependency on flexdll and OCAML used a binary delivery of flexdll. And this was something you didn't find out when building with opam. Complexity is a concern. It might be difficult to find someone who signs a letter stating which exact SW is in a Coq delivery if it is difficult to fully understand the build process.\n\nMy scripts results are not 100% binary identical, but they difer only in build dates and paths if built from cygwin and source archives. I test this by disassembling the binaries and comparing the disassmblies (filtering out dates and pathes). Up to now there was no deviation.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337554496","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5562#issuecomment-337554496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5562","id":337554496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NDQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T14:34:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:04:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @MSoegtropIMC\n\nDear Coq Team,\n\nfor the records: Coq does depend on camlp4 via CoqIDE and lablgtk.

One can argue that the new behaviour is correct, while the old one was more convenient for calling MinGW programs (like OCaml for MinGW) in cygwin. The result is that a lot of $(.... | sed ...) sequences in scripts now end up with a trailing carriage return which messes up the logic.\n\nI am not sure what is the best way to fix this - replace sed with a version which does cr-lf -> lf converion or add explicit cr removal in many places where it is required.

The problem is that all cygwin mirrors I know of only keep the current and the previous version and a working version will be gone soon (if there still is a working version). As a remedy one would have to supply the binary package for a working sed and copy it to the cygwin cache folder before running the scripts (or download it in the script from some INRIA server). Also one might have to patch the setup.ini file. This is doable as a temporary work around but not really something I would call a solution. An alternative would be to simply overwrite the sed executable with another version downloaded from some server (or comming with coq).\n\nI reported this on the cygwin list.
