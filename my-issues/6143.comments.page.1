Also SerAPI is fairly immature.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, SerAPI should end being nothing but a thin RPC layer, we are tying to improve the API upstream in all cases, so you do the same calls in SEXP or in ML. So indeed some improvements could be already used by the XML protocol or the text-based one.\r\n\r\nI am not against extending / reifying the XML protocol, but I see it as loss of time and would rather prefer a PPX to care of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/344587122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/344714887","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6143#issuecomment-344714887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6143","id":344714887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDcxNDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"psteckler","id":2244648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler","html_url":"https://github.com/psteckler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T20:15:32Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T20:15:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, we are leaving Jason to suffer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/344714887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345534056","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6143#issuecomment-345534056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6143","id":345534056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTUzNDA1Ng==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-19T17:26:53Z","updated_at":"2017-11-19T17:26:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JasonGross Isn't your slowness issue mostly fixed by the integration of lazy printing in 8.8?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/345534056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
