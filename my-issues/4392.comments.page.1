Typically, left and the like were transformed into a plain Ltac reference (think of some Ltac left := external \"left\").\n\nThe issue with grammar entries is that they display the \"global\" misdemeanour: you can break some code at great distance just because you messed up with the parsing engine, which is very sensitive to arcane details such as the keyword vs. identifier stuff.
