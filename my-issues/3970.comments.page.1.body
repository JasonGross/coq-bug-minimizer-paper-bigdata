Paste this into coqide:

Goal True.
  Tactic Notation "foo" := idtac.
  foo.


Then click "evaluate to bottom" to get this anomaly.  I can't get it to show up in PG nor coqc, so I suspect a bug in async processing.

Right the bug is there.

In the meanwhile don't put non-tactics between proof and Qed.

Will push soon the fix.
