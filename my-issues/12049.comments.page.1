As for the verbosity of the rest, I don't know. @SkySkimmer seemed to think that was fine, while @ppedrot complained about it on Gitter. Maybe there's a way to reduce it a little.\r\n\r\nThe ```ocamlformat: Must specify at least one input file, or `-` for stdin``` error only appears when no ML files are updated and you have `ocamlformat` in PATH. Similarly, when some ML files are updated and you have the wrong version of `ocamlformat` in PATH, you can get errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nocamlformat: Error while parsing .ocamlformat:\r\n             For option \"version\": expecting \"0.13.0\" but got \"0.14.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the output of `ocamlformat` is rarely interesting anyway, it seems to me that the best way to fix these two issues would be to redirect the output to `/dev/null`. I'll open a PR to do this in a minute.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/611436047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/611436862","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12049#issuecomment-611436862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12049","id":611436862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTQzNjg2Mg==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T09:45:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T09:45:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">@SkySkimmer seemed to think that was fine\r\n\r\nI don't care about commit hook noise because I don't see it.
