If I do

[Arguments f / .]

the section on [simpl] does not say how to restore the default [simpl] behavior 
of [f].  Since I'm not sure that there is a way to do this at all, I'm 
categorizing this under Main rather than Doc; if there is, in fact, a way to do 
this, please change the component of this bug.

I believe there is no way to clear simpl flags.
