The current algorithm for generating these successive numeric suffices is quadratic in the number of binders (a linear scan for the next available name) if I remember correctly (code in [namegen](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/efe60d3c1b09bc059053b7383e068ddc05248dac/engine/namegen.ml#L245)).

When I hand-code all of the names (I have to do it in two chunks because otherwise Coq's parser stack overflows), I get about 8 s for printing 5000 binders and about 32 s for printing 10000 binders.  So removing the actual renaming cuts out half the time (which is enormous).\r\n\r\nI am confused why Coq's linear scan is so slow; here is an implementation of the renaming bit I think you're talking about, in Python, that's about 3x faster:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\ns = set()\r\nfor i in range(10000):\r\n    j = 0\r\n    while 'x%d' % j in s:\r\n        j += 1\r\n    s.add('x%d' % j)\r\n```\r\n(about 21 s, compared to Coq's 60, to print).  If I remove the string manipulation, and just store integers, then it goes down to 3.7 seconds.   (This is still Python, and it's still quadratic.)\r\n\r\nSo, if this is indeed the bottleneck, then I propose augmenting the context with a map of prefix to potential first unused id.  Then you just start the linear scan from this location (as long as the context-names have O(1) membership check).  Something like the following in python, which runs in 0.06 s:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nd = dict()\r\ns = set()\r\nfor i in range(10000):\r\n    if 'x' not in d.keys(): d['x'] = 0\r\n    j = d['x']\r\n    while 'x%d' % j in s:\r\n        j += 1\r\n    s.add('x%d' % j)\r\n    d['x'] = j\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/436100717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/436103175","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8909#issuecomment-436103175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8909","id":436103175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjEwMzE3NQ==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T01:51:31Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T01:51:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh, ew, is Coq's linear scan slow because it's *reparsing* the string identifier to increment it on every subiteration?

Another possible reason is that the logic for computing the next id is [pretty complicated](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/efe60d3c1b09bc059053b7383e068ddc05248dac/engine/nameops.ml#L63), and of course while people are still relying on the specifics of the automatic name generation algorithm (another reason for me to fix the remaining bugs with `-mangle-names`...) changing this to be faster or simpler introduces potential problems with compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe potential issue with the quadratic algorithm to identify which binders should be printed and which shouldn't would still remain.\r\nSince native let always show the binder name, replacing `dlet` with `let` in the experiment might allow you to distinguish how much of a problem that is causing, if at all (there should be a linear algorithm to do the same thing, and Coq might already be using that in which case this line of inquiry is off target).\r\n\r\n(I'll also add that none of my speculation is backed up by profiling.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/436132923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/436175210","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8909#issuecomment-436175210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8909","id":436175210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjE3NTIxMA==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T08:49:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T08:49:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Indeed, printing of nested binders is at least quadratic and even cubic in some cases IIRC.
