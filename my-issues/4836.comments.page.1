author: @JasonGross\n\nThe commit which introduced this bug is \n\ncommit 802366bdf00adf3849499f43ba07ee726da0668a\nAuthor: Enrico Tassi <Enrico.Tassi@ inria.fr>\nDate:   Thu May 19 07:41:09 2016 +0200\n\n    coqc: support -o option to specify output file name\n\n    The -o option lets one put .vo or .vio files in a directory of choice,\n    i.e. decouple the location of the sources and the compiled files.\n    This ease the integration of Coq in already existing IDEs that handle\n    the build process automatically (eg Eclipse) and also enables one to\n    compile/run at the same time 2 versions of Coq on the same sources.\n\n    Example: b.v depending on a.v\n\n      coq8.6/bin/coqc -R out8.6 Test src/a.v -o out8.6/a.vo\n      coq8.6/bin/coqc -R out8.6 Test src/b.v -o out8.6/b.vo\n\n      coq8.7/bin/coqc -R out8.7 Test src/a.v -o out8.7/a.vo\n      coq8.7/bin/coqc -R out8.7 Test src/b.v -o out8.7/b.vo\n\nI'm a bit confused how Coq builds at all, given that running\n\n  ./bin/coqtop -compile foo -nois -boot\n\nin the root of the coq source tree (with or without a foo.v file) is already enough to trigger the anomaly...\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337543969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337543970","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4836#issuecomment-337543970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4836","id":337543970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0Mzk3MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T23:27:06Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:30:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
