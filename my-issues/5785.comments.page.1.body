In Coq 8.6, Makefile.install has:
	$(MKDIR) $(FULLCOQLIB)/toploop
	$(INSTALLBIN) $(TOPLOOPCMA) $(FULLCOQLIB)/toploop/

In Coq 8.7, the first line was lost (I think by 
https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/7a14df13a771651973da980eb9ab5c6608ffdcef or 
https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/419e7cac23d7b8ac97d46a6c0d3228d591273d2b).
