(* = 3 : nat *)\n\nI expect to see [pl 1 2], not [3], but because [m] is a section variable, the arguments get lost.  I think that this should not happen; I would prefer that the [simpl] modifiers are preserved after the section ends, but if they are not, I think that Coq should definitely warn that this is happening (either as section close, or, preferably, it should warn the the [Global] modifier will have no effect at the [Arguments] line.)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337517311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
