This is a regression with respect to 8.4. Here is a reduced testcase.

Inductive T := Foo : T.
Axiom (b : T) (R : forall x : T, Prop) (f : forall x : T, R x).
Axiom a1 : match b with Foo => f end = f.
Axiom a2 : match b with Foo => f b end = f b.
Hint Rewrite a1 : bar.
Hint Rewrite a2 : bar.

With respect to bug [BZ#3509](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%233509%22), the hints are added one after the other instead of both at once.

Right, I am the culprit:

dc438047cc7d20d4f2df6ab703689814a7552623 is the first bad commit

    Removing a Pervasives.compare in Term_dnet.

Not sure why it breaks the code though.
