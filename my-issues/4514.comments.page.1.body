The following should work:

Goal True /\ True /\ False.
Proof.
  split; [ | split ].
  par: try exact I.

Currently, it says something like "Error: no progress".

(It would be nice to support partial progress on goals, too, but if this is too hard, I'd be fine with having to wrap my tactics with [try solve [ ... ]] to get them to work nicely with [par:].)

This seems fixed in 8.6.
