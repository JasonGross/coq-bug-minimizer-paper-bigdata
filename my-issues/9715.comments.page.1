However, I don't think the time overhead in `Print Ltac` is significant.  Even if it takes a full second to print my complicated tactic, that's fine, because `Print Ltac` is not a bottleneck in most compile-edit-debug cycles.  (Goal printing time, on the other hand, is absolutely a bottleneck in many cases.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/546503135/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/546515150","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9715#issuecomment-546515150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/9715","id":546515150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjUxNTE1MA==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T21:12:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T21:12:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> there are [other](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9716) [bugs](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6613) that mean\r\n\r\nThe Coq quotation system has to be improved indeed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/546515150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
