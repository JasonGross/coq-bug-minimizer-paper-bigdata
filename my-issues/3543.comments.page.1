This would give links more stability across versions, because chapter titles and section names are less likely to change than location.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337522894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337522895","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3543#issuecomment-337522895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3543","id":337522895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMjg5NQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-26T17:55:15Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:28:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nThis is a good remark, but we are relying here not on coqdoc but on hevea.
