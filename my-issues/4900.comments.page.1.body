If [Fail foo] takes longer than a second, then [Timeout 1 Fail foo] should fail with a timeout, rather than succeeding, claiming that [foo] failed with the message "Timeout!".


This is still bothering me.

Still an issue:
```coq
Require Import List.

Fail Timeout 1 Eval cbv in (fold_left plus (seq 0 250) 0).
Timeout 1 Fail Eval cbv in (fold_left plus (seq 0 250) 0).
```
