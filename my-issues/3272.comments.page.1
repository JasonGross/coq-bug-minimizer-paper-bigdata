Qed. are handled as regular\n    definitions, hence they have universe constraints coming from the type\n    and from the body.  Only the former set was returned to libstack, but\n    both sets were added to the global universe graph.  Hence, at section\n    closing time, an incomplete set of universe constraints was added back\n    to the global graph (End Section replays the libstack) and hence saved\n    in the .vo file.  coqchk was right in reporting missing constraints.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518467","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3272#issuecomment-337518467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3272","id":337518467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxODQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-21T15:57:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:15:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nThis test was actually removed, after unplugging the XML printer.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
