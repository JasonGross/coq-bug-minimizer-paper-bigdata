It's \neasy to check which it is using Set Typeclasses Depth 0 which will make \nresolution fail immediately. Maybe using Hint Opaque foo : rewrite. for a few \nconstants you don't want to unfold during unification of the lemma would help \n(these hints are used by setoid_rewrite).\n\nHope this helps,\n-- Matthieu\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no documentation at \nhttps://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual010.html#sec398 about this database:\n\n8.9.2  Hint databases defined in the Coq standard library\n\nSeveral hint databases are defined in the Coq standard library. The actual \ncontent of a database is the collection of the hints declared to belong to this \ndatabase in each of the various modules currently loaded. Especially, requiring \nnew modules potentially extend a database. At Coq startup, only the core and \nv62 databases are non empty and can be used.\n\ncore\nThis special database is automatically used by auto, except when \npseudo-database nocore is given to auto. The core database contains only basic \nlemmas about negation, conjunction, and so on from. Most of the hints in this \ndatabase come from the Init and Logic directories.\narith\nThis database contains all lemmas about Peanoâ€™s arithmetic proved in the \ndirectories Init and Arith\nzarith\ncontains lemmas about binary signed integers from the directories \ntheories/ZArith. When required, the module Omega also extends the database \nzarith with a high-cost hint that calls omega on equations and inequalities in \nnat or Z.\nbool\ncontains lemmas about booleans, mostly from directory theories/Bool.\ndatatypes\nis for lemmas about lists, streams and so on that are mainly proved in the \nLists subdirectory.\nsets\ncontains lemmas about sets and relations from the directories Sets and \nRelations.\ntypeclass_instances\ncontains all the type class instances declared in the environment, including \nthose used for setoid_rewrite, from the Classes directory.\nThere is also a special database called v62. It collects all hints that were \ndeclared in the versions of Coq prior to version 6.2.4 when the databases core, \narith, and so on were introduced. The purpose of the database v62 is to ensure \ncompatibility with further versions of Coq for developments done in versions \nprior to 6.2.4 (auto being replaced by auto with v62). The database v62 is \nintended not to be extended (!). It is not included in the hint databases list \nused in the auto with * tactic.\n\nFurthermore, you are advised not to put your own hints in the core database, \nbut use one or several databases specific to your development.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/470100140","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5025#issuecomment-470100140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5025","id":470100140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDEwMDE0MA==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T13:06:58Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T13:06:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mattam82 Do you intend to address this in the foreseeable future?
