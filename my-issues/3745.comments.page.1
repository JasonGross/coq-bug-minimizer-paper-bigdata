You have two induction principles (bar and bar') defined for bool2 over sort Set; which one do you expect induction to chose? In fact, you even have four of them since baz and baz' have also suitable types.\n\nIn other words, if you have only one scheme, give it the name induction expects. If you have several of them, explicitly use \"induction using\"; do not expect induction to chose one arbitrarily.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337526241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
