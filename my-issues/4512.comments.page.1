This can cause problems with OS migrations and upgrades, and Windows telemetry tools may not accurately report info about the app. \n\n\n•How to fix:  Add the necessary info to the app’s Windows Installer package so it can configure Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel correctly.

not one of the application’s main executables (has a shortcut on start menu or desktop), they can safely be ignored. All others need to be signed to meet the Windows App Certification requirements. \n•Impact if not fixed:  Having digitally signed files allows users to know that software is genuine. It makes it possible to detect that a file has been tampered with, such as by a virus. Windows has the ability to prevent any unsigned app from launching with administrator access. Sign the app if you want it to operate correctly in locked-down environments without popup or UAC messages. \n\n•How to fix:  You can safely ignore the unsigned DLL, .OCX, .SCR, .CPL or .EXE files listed here that are not one of the app’s main executable, or a driver. All files except drivers must be Authenticode signed, drivers must be WHQL certified.

Apps that don’t create the required registry entries may not be found by enterprise inventory tools. This can cause problems with OS migrations and upgrades, and Windows telemetry tools may not accurately report info about the app. \n\n\n•How to fix:  Add the necessary info to the app’s Windows Installer package so it can configure Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel correctly. Setting these properties automatically writes the corresponding values into the registry.

All others need to be signed to meet the Windows App Certification requirements. \n•Impact if not fixed:  Having digitally signed files allows users to know that software is genuine. It makes it possible to detect that a file has been tampered with, such as by a virus. Windows has the ability to prevent any unsigned app from launching with administrator access. Sign the app if you want it to operate correctly in locked-down environments without popup or UAC messages. \n\n•How to fix:  You can safely ignore the unsigned DLL, .OCX, .SCR, .CPL or .EXE files listed here that are not one of the app’s main executable, or a driver. All files except drivers must be Authenticode signed, drivers must be WHQL certified.
