This means that `NEWGOAL` can be filled by using `initialname` and that this behavior is expected. However, the open_constr that represents `e` in the Ltac environment does not get updated when `rename` is called, rendering `e` essentially useless. Specifically, I think the evar substitution that forms open_constr `e` from evar `NEWGOAL` contains a reference to `initialname` (before and after `rename`). To make matters worse, `exact`/`refine` happily solves the goal using a dangling open_constr. I don't understand why the latter happens, but might it be related to the infamous #8014? Jason proposed a workaround for this above.\r\n\r\n```coq\r\nGoal True -> True.\r\n  refine (fun initialname => ?[FIRSTGOAL]);\r\n    unshelve (\r\n      let e := open_constr:(?[NEWGOAL]) in\r\n      rename initialname into newname;\r\n      exact e).\r\n\r\n  (* initialname : True\r\n     ========================= (1 / 1)\r\n     True *)\r\n  Show Proof.

I don't understand why the latter happens, but might it be related to the infamous #8014? \r\n\r\nYes, checking that the open_constr is well-formed is at best linear in the size of the open_constr, and at worst involves arbitrarily expensive conversion checks to see if changes in the types of named variables are innocuous or not.  As we saw in #8014, this costs almost 10% in fiat-crypto.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/642074401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/642095515","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9937#issuecomment-642095515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/9937","id":642095515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjA5NTUxNQ==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T15:46:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T15:46:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We could have less expensive dynamic checks though. I believe that we could store the state in which a term was generated, and check that if it doesn't correspond to the one in which it is used, we can trigger varying levels of checks depending on the tactic at hand. This kind of problems is even more salient in Ltac2 since one can generate broken terms via low-level APIs, no question asked.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/642095515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
