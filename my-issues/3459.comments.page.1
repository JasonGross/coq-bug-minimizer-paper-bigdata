This fast type-checker (`get_type_of`) does the minimum to infer the type of a term assuming the term is already type-checked.\r\n\r\nIn 8.4, eq was inductive-polymorphic and the arguments of `eq_refl` were checked (here `x`). In 8.5, `eq` is not \"template polymorphic\" and the arguments of `eq_refl` are not checked any more.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could use the complete type-checker (`type_of`) to prevent the anomaly, but is this what you really want.\r\n\r\nConsider e.g. a situation\r\n\r\n```\r\nGoal nat -> nat -> nat.\r\nintros a b.\r\nlet r:=a in clear a; rename b into a; apply r.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo we want it to succeed and build the proof `fun a b => b` or to fail?\r\n\r\nI guess we want it to fail.
