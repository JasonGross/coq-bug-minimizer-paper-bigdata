(I am fine with it erroring if there are relevant evars left un-instantiated when the tactic finishes.)  The use-case is shoving the terms generated by repeated rewriting into a separate name, to speed up [Defined], for example by doing \"etransitivity; [ evar_aware_abstract (repeat rewrite ...; reflexivity) | ]\".  I do not care much whether the resulting lemma is transparent or opaque, but it might be nice to be able to tune this.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519156","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3308#issuecomment-337519156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3308","id":337519156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTE1Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-09T23:27:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:17:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\n\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug [BZ#2386](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%232386%22) ***\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
