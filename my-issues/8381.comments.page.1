As long as we consider that the expected behavior of compatibility aliases is only to generate a deprecation warning even without using the `-compat` option, it makes sense to test this in the test-suite (see also #6840).\r\nA path to solve the inconsistency in #6840 and thus this issue as well would be to make the deprecated attribute (see https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/artifacts/master/file/_install_ci/share/doc/coq/sphinx/html/language/gallina-specification-language.html?job=documentation#attributes) work with Definitions / Notations as well. Then this use case would be handled by this other mechanism and we could change the semantics of compatibility aliases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/417916268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/428292023","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8381#issuecomment-428292023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8381","id":428292023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODI5MjAyMw==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T18:05:25Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T18:05:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JasonGross This was fixed in #8634, correct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/428292023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/428298672","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8381#issuecomment-428298672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8381","id":428298672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODI5ODY3Mg==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T18:24:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T18:24:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The compatibility notation usage was fixed in #8634, but there is not currently anything preventing reintroduction of usage of compat notations in the test-suite, which may or may not be worth being careful about.
