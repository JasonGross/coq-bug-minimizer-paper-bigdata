In fedora installing ocaml-lablgtk-devel pulls gtksourceview2, but not gtksourceview2-devel, which is what CoqIDE really needs to compile properly. So if you only install the former you get a .so.0 library instead of the .so that ld is looking for.\n\nCl√©ment.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535925","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4307#issuecomment-337535925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4307","id":337535925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzNTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T08:54:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:05:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nSo, what do you suggest?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337535926","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4307#issuecomment-337535926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4307","id":337535926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzNTkyNg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T09:31:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:05:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nI guess that, ultimately, we should try to compile a minimal application at configure time (as is done in the autoconf world) rather than just checking whether some files exist.
