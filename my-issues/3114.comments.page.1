This is useful, for example, if you replace the standard library, and require that to build before your main files, but want to `-include` the file generated by coq_makefile for the rest of the code to automatically get targets like `html`.  In particular, I want a way to make the .vo targets of the generated makefile, but not the `clean` target, depend on some other .vo files.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515674","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3114#issuecomment-337515674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3114","id":337515674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxNTY3NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-08T20:09:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:07:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @pirbo\n\nI'm sorry.
