So, you want a parsing-time disambiguation similar to what can be already achieved with type-class based notations? Is it to avoid having to see the projection of the type class? Or another technical reason?

Indeed that would delay the interpretation to use time and thus be a change of perspective. It is unclear whether this would marry well with the existing framework but I like the idea.
