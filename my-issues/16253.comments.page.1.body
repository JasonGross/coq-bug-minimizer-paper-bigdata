You want `stdlib-html`, if you need to be backwards compatible we could probably add a `doc-stdlib-html` target that does the same thing.
Backwards compatibility not necessary, thanks!
Keep in mind @JasonGross that the location of the docs artifacts have changed too.

The build setup for the docs has also changed, for example we now support building docs from an installed Coq and a few other things, please don't hesitate to ping us in Zulip if you have any question.
