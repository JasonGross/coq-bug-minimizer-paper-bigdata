(See also https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues/21.)  If I write\n  -arg \"-compat 8.4\"\nthen coq_makefile works, but PG tries to pass \"-compat 8.4\" to coqc (as a single argument, rather than -compat 8.4 as two arguments), which fails.  If I write\n  -arg -compat -arg 8.4\nthen PG works, but coq_makefile tries to pass\n  8.4 -compat\nto coqc, which fails.

As to why coq_makefile outputs the arguments in reverse order while it uses the same parsing code as coqide, I have no clue.
