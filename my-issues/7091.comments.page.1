Do you mean \"call the `pattern` tactic\"? At first view, that would not be (too) complicated to extend pattern-matching problems of the form `@?f x1 ... xn` == `t` to problems of the form `@?f t1 ... tn` == `t` when `t1`, ..., `tn` are non-overlapping closed terms, using some kind of equality such as either syntactic equality (up to Î±-conversion) or even an equality modulo some reduction rules.\r\n\r\nIf these terms have holes themselves, we shall have other design choices to take into account. Like in the case of say a `destruct (S _)`, this is for instance less clear what to do when matching against `@?f u` when `u` has holes. Do we take the first subterm matching as the subterm to be matched and collect all other subterms that match this first subterm (so-called `LikeFirst` strategy in `Find_subterm`)? Do we fail if there are several disjoint subterms matching? Which notion of \"disjoint\" do we use?\r\n\r\nOK, let's not necessarily address the most sophisticated cases at once. I have listed some of the design decisions we may have to eventually take, but if you are only interested at the current time with disjoint arguments compared up to syntactic equality (or even full conversion), that's probably a good first issue to be implemented, indeed inserting a call to `Tacred.pattern_occs` in the `PSoApp` case of `Constr_matching.matching_core`, and relaxing the syntax of `PSoApp` in the grammar to support arbitrary terms.\r\n\r\n[Edited for refining]\r\n\r\nPS: I believe that supporting this is (morally) independent of Ltac or Ltac2 (up to syntactic considerations).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/376870218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/376898893","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7091#issuecomment-376898893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/7091","id":376898893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Njg5ODg5Mw==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T14:05:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T14:05:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, I mean \"calls the ` pattern` tactic.
