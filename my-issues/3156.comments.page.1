Unfortunately, .lnk files are called \"shortcuts\" for a reason: they are not symlinks. In fact, the operating system (kernel32) is completely unaware of their existence; they are just a hack inside the shell (shell32).\n\nWindows actually supports proper symlinks, but you have to use the \"mklink\" command to create them. And Cygwin supports them too, if you set the CYGWIN environment variable to \"winsymlinks:nativestrict\". (Note that this is not the default behavior for Cygwin!)\n\nPlease reopen this bug if Coq fails to follow native symlinks.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
