We use a magic number per version, so the magic number is the same from one instance of the trunk to another instance of the trunk, even though the vo files might have incompatible structure.\n\nIn particular, I just checked that it correctly checks that the magic number is incorrect when calling a 8.4 library from trunk.\n\nHugo\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521630","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3466#issuecomment-337521630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3466","id":337521630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMTYzMA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T15:57:02Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:24:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nOh, I see.
