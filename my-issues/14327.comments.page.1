Then (again passing `COQBIN`) I run `make printenv`.  There should be one line with the -R/-Q flags, one line with -I flags, and then there's also a printout of COQPATH which is important to set as an environment variable (though I suppose it can be replaced by appropriate -Q and -I flags.  My guess is that what you want is `-R _build_ci/fiat_crypto/src Crypto` and then set `COQPATH=_build_ci/rewriter/src` or pass both `-Q _build_ci/rewriter/src/Rewriter Rewriter` and `-I _build_ci/rewriter/src/Rewriter`\r\n\r\n>  I see the source file in the Crypto tree but I don't see an API.vo or API.vos anywhere in the build tree.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the build failed before getting far enough because it also depends on coqprime (ci-coqprime?), and you need to make that and pass paths for that?  Again, I think `make ci-fiat_crypto` takes care of this.\r\n\r\n> Also I notice that the scrolling position in the buffer jumps around a bit erratically\r\n\r\nI've never seen this, but then again I don't use CoqIDE much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/848534360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/849119080","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14327#issuecomment-849119080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14327","id":849119080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTExOTA4MA==","user":{"login":"jfehrle","id":1253341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1253341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle","html_url":"https://github.com/jfehrle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfehrle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-26T21:09:12Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T21:09:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I got it to work.\r\n\r\nIf I disable generating all the messages on the Coq side, running `make_rewriter` with the debugger enabled and no breakpoints set is 13% slower than running with the debugger disabled.
