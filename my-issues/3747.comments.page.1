But apart from being particularly awful in my opinion, it wouldn't actually be consistent with the rest of Ltac:\n\nGoal True -> True.\nProof.\n  Fail let x:=constr:0 in intros x.\n  (* Error: Ltac variable x is bound to 0 which cannot be coerced to an introduction pattern. *)\n\nAlso: shadowing isn't bad.
