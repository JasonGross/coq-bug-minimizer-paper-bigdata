Yet, some time ago you've asked for the converse position in a bug report I can't encounter anymore. Do we agree that the former behaviour is the good one?\n\nIf so, I think I can make typing errors uncatchable, even though I'm pretty sure that there are scripts out there that rely on the contrary (most probably including some of yours).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337542503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337542504","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4734#issuecomment-337542504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4734","id":337542504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MjUwNA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T22:57:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:25:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nHrm, I guess you're referring to bug [BZ#4144](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%234144%22)?\n\nI am of two minds: when writing tactics, I sometimes use failures like this as signals to backtrack (though I've since learned better ways to fail in constr-land, like [constr:(I : I)]); when debugging things that broke when porting code to 8.5, I want to know when these errors occur.\n\nAfter being reminded of this, I think my position is now that [try] should catch these errors (until we can make them break at compile-time), but we should always emit warnings when such things occur (that is, don't silently drop typing errors, but emit warnings).
