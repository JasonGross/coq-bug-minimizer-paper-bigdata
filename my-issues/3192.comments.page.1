For example, I would like to be able to do\r\n```coq\r\nRequire Foo.Bar (as Baz.Qux).\r\n```\r\nand get the same effect as if I had renamed `Foo/Bar.v` to `Baz/Qux.v` and then did `Require Baz.Qux.`\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I would like to be able to do something like\r\n```coq\r\nImport Foo.Bar (into Baz.Qux).\r\n```\r\nand there-after be able to refer to `Foo.Bar.x` as `Baz.Qux.x`.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3173, mostly because I don't have a sharp idea of what the best semantics to use for namespacing are, but I know how I'm unsatisfied with the current ones.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337517055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
