So either coq_makefile should be parallelizable and should include a rule to regenerate the makefile using itself when any of the targets change (this seems like it might be a pain, though), or the makefile should keep using coqdep.\n\nPierre Boutillier was kind enough to try to reproduce this with me when I was at IHP, and couldn't reproduce.  So I'm inclined to believe that the issue is me compiling the versions with different settings (maybe one was bytecode and the other opt, or maybe one was debug and the other not), or something.  As soon as I get a chance to make a thorough test of settings, I'm planning on updating and probably closing this bug.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519293","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3316#issuecomment-337519293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3316","id":337519293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTI5Mw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-11T11:36:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:17:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @pirbo\n\nNo news, good news ?\nI recheck today and do not see difference ...\nReopen it if you manage to see how to reproduce...\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
