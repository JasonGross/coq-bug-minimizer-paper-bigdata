This is my desired behavior; it allows me to see how fast a file is processed.  In 8.5, it also prints the intermediate goals, which is definitely not what I want.  Please fix/revert the behavior of this flag (and if there is demand for goal printing separate from -emacs, make a new flag with a different name)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337544044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337544045","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4841#issuecomment-337544045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4841","id":337544045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NDA0NQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T16:09:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:30:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nFixed by commit 3f64bf1.
