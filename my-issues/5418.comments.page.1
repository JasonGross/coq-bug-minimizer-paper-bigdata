In the code prior to my PR on pretty printing, errors could be printed by the \"logger\" (then using the emacs-specific markers) but some other errors were printer by a different toplevel error printer, that didn't insert that markers.\n\nHow emacs dealt with that, I don't know. But my PR shifted all error printing to the toplevel printer (which IMO is the right place) so the markers may not be inserted anymore.\n\nI'll take care of it next week so you don't need to introduce

Also one minor comment, I was a bit surprised that the response to \"Coq is doing something wrong\" was \"lets add a workaround in PG\".\n\nIMHO, it would be more productive if we tried \"lets fix Coq\", at least when it is feasible to do. I think we got too used to try to \"workaround Coq\".\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552269","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5418#issuecomment-337552269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5418","id":337552269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MjI2OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T19:52:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:57:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @psteckler\n\nIt wasn't clear to me that Coq was doing something wrong, exactly, maybe just incomplete.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552270","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5418#issuecomment-337552270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5418","id":337552270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MjI3MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T19:57:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:57:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @Matafou\n\nIn the past I proceeded like this: first workaround in pg because the bug is there for some time and I want it to be fixed for users using pg with old versions of coq.
