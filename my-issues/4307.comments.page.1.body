The configure script should not enable coqide if make is just going to fail with "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgtksourceview-2.0" when making coqide.

Coq is relying on the presence of the lablgtk2 libraries which, if the system is consistently installed, implies the presence of the gtksourceview-2.0 library. So my first guess is that something is wrong with your installation, and more information should be given about the files and dependencies of the lablgtk2 on your system.

Hi Hugo and Jason,

The issue here seems to be that ./configure is checking for the presence of the library, but not of the development version thereof. In fedora installing ocaml-lablgtk-devel pulls gtksourceview2, but not gtksourceview2-devel, which is what CoqIDE really needs to compile properly. So if you only install the former you get a .so.0 library instead of the .so that ld is looking for.

ClÃ©ment.

So, what do you suggest?

I guess that, ultimately, we should try to compile a minimal application at configure time (as is done in the autoconf world) rather than just checking whether some files exist. (We do not even check whether they are compatible.)

Looking through the source of what autoconf generates for, e.g., ..., it looks like we could test something like the return status of running
  pkg-config --short-errors --print-errors "gtksourceview-2.0 >= 2.2.0"

Alternatively, right, we could make a minimal ocmal file that uses gtksourceview and check that it compiles.

Oops, forgot to fill in the link.  I meant to say, "Looking through the source of what autoconf generates for, e.g., https://github.com/aanjhan/GNUSim8085/blob/master/configure.in"

At least when it comes to opam, the installation should now behave slightly better. (See bug [BZ#4345](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%234345%22))


This is IMO a Fedora bug; the way Coq builds CoqIDE now depends on `ocamlfind` so that should sorted out at the OS install level. If `ocamlfind` returns a positive match for sourceview all its dependencies should be installed.
