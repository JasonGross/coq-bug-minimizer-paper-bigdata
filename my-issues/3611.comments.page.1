And I don't see anything that could cause the code to go wrong when toploop is missing. (On the contrary, when toploop is missing, no dynamic library will be loaded, so there isn't any imported bug.) Please reopen if you are still able to reproduce it.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
