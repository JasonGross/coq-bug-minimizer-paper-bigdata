As I said to you on Gitter, this is not about Nix, this is about the documentation builds (they sometimes fail with such timeouts in any documentation build).

There are two possibilities that I can see: remove this timeout entirely or have @coqbot restart the job automatically. The problems in both cases is that sometimes these timeouts are *not spurious*: if someone introduced a command in the reference manual that definitely takes too long to execute, or if someone forgot a trailing `.`
@Zimmi48  Is this still an issue?
I haven't seen such issues in a while. It probably means that our runners are more reliable and our timeout is long enough to avoid them. Can be reopened if this happens again.
