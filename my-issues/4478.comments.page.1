Shouldn't it rather become a wish for an improvement to the unification engine? In that case, it's probably better to open a new issue: it's difficult to know what needs to be done when reading this one.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I was thinking this night about a remark that several developers made:\r\n\r\n> we have a poorly specified system\r\n\r\nand to the fact that today, it is a very standard practice in the industry to do \"Test-Driven Development\", i.e. never write anything new without first writing a test for it. Following this practice would have helped specifying better what problems the unification engine should solve, or in a case that interests me more what behavior `auto` and `eauto` should have (and avoid these crazy inconsistencies that we have today, from lack of a common specification).\r\n\r\nSo I suppose that instead of re-opening this bug, without a clear plan on what should be done, it would be better instead to make #6344 a reality and feed it also with tests of things that are failing today but we wish to make work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/353722272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/353722865","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4478#issuecomment-353722865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4478","id":353722865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzcyMjg2NQ==","user":{"login":"herbelin","id":460771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDc3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/460771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin","html_url":"https://github.com/herbelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-23T12:08:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T12:08:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> the old behavior was described as \"counter-intuitive\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely my point, `apply f, g` cannot anyway be interpreted as `apply f; apply g` (at best, it could be `apply f; [ .. | apply g]` - or `apply f; last apply g` using the cool `last` from ssreflect).\r\n\r\nAnd, in the same way as `intros pat pat'` is not the same as `intros pat; intros pat'` (e.g. because when, using `_`, the clean is done - and can only be done - at the end), I think it is more intuitive in practice that `apply (f_equal S), H` works, on the argument that it leaves no evars afterwards, than having to do `eapply (f_equal S), H` just because of an internal evar produced by `f_equal` but an evar which is solved afterwards by `H`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/353722865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/353723116","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4478#issuecomment-353723116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4478","id":353723116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzcyMzExNg==","user":{"login":"herbelin","id":460771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDc3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/460771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin","html_url":"https://github.com/herbelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herbelin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-23T12:15:22Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T12:15:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PS: it is not a unification regression here.
