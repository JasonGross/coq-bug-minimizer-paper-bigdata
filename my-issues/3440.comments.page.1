The main issue with this compatibility layer is the use of application-like parsing for primitive projections: [f a] meaning a.(f) and at the same time @ f _ a being printed as [f a] (supposing the record has 1 parameter). You're suggesting a mode where the eta-expansion constant is not used, just it's body? Then the elaboration of @ f _ a would be beta-reducible to a.(f). But in partially applied cases you would see things like (fun x : Rec B => f x) in the goals, would that be alright?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521154","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3440#issuecomment-337521154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3440","id":337521154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMTE1NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T13:25:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:23:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nI'm no longer sure the mode where the body is used is a good idea.  What I'm really after is \"as much as possible, existing code should just work when you [Set Primitive Projections]\".  Whether you do this by making it so that the tactics use equivalence classes of symbols like Matita, as Enrico suggested on coq-club, and put @ proj and proj in the same class, or by using eta-expanded bodies instead of separate constants (if that works), I don't think matters that much.  Regardless, I once the \"Primitive projection not applied to enough arguments\" messages disappear, I can give you examples that used to work that don't anymore, and possibly more ideas, if I have any.
