Apparently there's a variant of econstructor that applies a tactic to all subgoals, and only chooses a constructor on which the tactic will succeed on all subgoals.  This should be documented.

This tactic has been removed from trunk in commit 07a9afbdf, as it was never documented, and moreover the new constructor tactic allows to do it natively in Ltac: [econstructor tac] is the same as [once (econstructor; tac)].
