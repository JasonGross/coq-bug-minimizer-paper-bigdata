Possibly relevant: all times that I've seen this have come from me retrying a single failed job
Unfortunately we still do manual cleanup of old/stale docker images; at some point we may automate this, but still, out-of-date branches may need a merge/rebase to run successfully.

This is in general hard to avoid without introducing a non-trivial startup penalty on the CI side. 
To be clear, what happens is that your PR is using an out-of-date docker image version; the solution is to rebase it, or run the job with `SKIP_DOCKER=false`
I don't think that's the issue here.  Perhaps this was true of the first time I got it, but the second time I got it, I retried it just a couple hours after the pushing, and no commits have been merged into master in the meantime, so the branch is still up to date
That's bizarre, indeed that docker image is actually OK and available in the registry
Interestingly, I retried two different jobs from https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/11029 at the same time, and one went through, and the other failed with this error.
Maybe some gitlab mirroring problem?
And, in fact, it keeps failing again and again on engine-bench in this way, almost every time I retry: https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/565574321

Looks like it happens iff the runner is `VM-07e3a7b9-6845-48d2-a942-2899dd2e5f73 (#857051)` (at least I've seen multiple shared runner jobs and 1 pyrolise job succeed, and the first VM-XXX job I found failed https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/565943260.)
Since gitlab detects it as a "runner system failure" it gets auto-retried and I guess we only see it if the retry gets the same runner.
So IIUC this runner never works? Then a quick fix is to just pause it (https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/settings/ci_cd) since it is one of our own runners.
Closing this as it seems like a transient bug.

@Zimmi48 would be maybe nice to have either a `resolved: transient` or `kind: transient` tag?
