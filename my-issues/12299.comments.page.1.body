I believe this is a duplicate of #3608.
Ah, I see.  Would it be possible to expose the `Future.purify` function in a way that allows me to wrap a tactic in it?  (I'd be happy with some 8.11-compatible plugin code that exposed this, while waiting for #3608 to be solved.). Also, what's the quadratic (or worse) overhead in the global env coming from?  Some sort of fresh name generation issue?  Or name-avoidance?
