I wonder if, once these mechanisms support blacklisting/whitelisting constants, there'd be a way to forbid just delta reduction under remaining lambdas?

The way it currently works is that it takes any remaining lambda-abstractions, apply them to dummy opaque arguments, and give them back to the bytecode interpreter in turn. More precisely, the lambda-abstractions directly come from the original term but their free variables are reduced values. But there is no reason to give the lambda-abstractions back to the bytecode interpreter, we could give them (or rather their original Gallina counterpart) to any other reduction engine. The free variables being already reduced, it is not difficult to retrieve them and pass them to another reduction engine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/787055013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
