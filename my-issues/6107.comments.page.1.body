At the moment `rewrite_strat` works only in the goal? Is there a workaround for rewriting in hypotheses?
You can revert your hypotheses, rewrite, then introduce them.  I believe this is how ssr's rewrite works, though I'm not sure.
I'd love to see this fixed!
I don't think it's that difficult but I've little time right now, would someone like to try? I can provide hints for sure.
I had a quick look and essentially it means adapting Equality.general_rewrite_clause to rewrite_strat/setoid_rewrite
