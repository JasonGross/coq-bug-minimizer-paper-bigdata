It seems to have something to do with having a G' to the left of an arrow in the type that results from [abstract].  This should not be the case!  Adding this type to the environment should not be expensive.  The attached file demonstrates this issue.\n\nNote that this is not a bug in [abstract]; the [Defined] in the following is also slow:\n\n  Goal forall str : @ String Char splitter,\n         let G' :=\n             @ BooleanRecognizer.parse_nonterminal Char splitter splitter G parser_data str G = true in\n         G' -> Prop.\n    admit.\n  Defined.\n\nwhile if I remove the [-> Prop], it is instantaneous.\n\nHere is the debug trace on [abstract admit]:\nFile \"./bug_opt_parser_slow_admit_03.v\", line 711, characters 4-58:\nTimeout!\nframe @  file \"toplevel/coqtop.ml\", line 588,
