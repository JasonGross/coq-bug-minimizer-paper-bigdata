So, if you are asking it to prove z = 0, you are actually adding z <> 0 as a new hypothesis. So you have the following hypotheses:\n\n  H1: d * z >= 0\n  H2: d - d * z - 1 >= 0\n  H3: z - 1 >= 0 (and another set of hypotheses with 1 - z >= 0)\n\nThen it performs addition and multiplication of all these hypotheses in order to get a contradiction such as -1 >= 0. You would have to look at the proof to know which combination it chose. I have not double-checked, but given the hypotheses, H3 * (1 + H1 + H2) + H2 should do the trick.\n\nNotice how crucial it is that z - 1 >= 0 appears as a hypothesis right from the start. The property z = 0 is never deduced!\n\nAs always, non-linear integer arithmetic is hard.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
