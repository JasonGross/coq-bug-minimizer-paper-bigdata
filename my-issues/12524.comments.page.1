A linear amount of quadratic code results in cubic behaviour.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have a patch that uses the same strategy as in the pretyper, but the problem is that there are other parts in the proof engine that are linear in the size of the context. After this patch, there is still a quadratic behaviour from clenv creation, and it's very hard to fix without rewriting a variant of the API taking advantage of the additional caching. I believe that the proper fix is to move away from kernel environments in the proof engine and use instead structures similar to the pretyper, but *pervasively*. It's a lot of work though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/650761633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/650776740","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12524#issuecomment-650776740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12524","id":650776740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDc3Njc0MA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-28T15:07:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T15:07:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh, I see.\r\n\r\nWhat strategy does the pretyper use?\r\n\r\nWhat's the clenv?\r\n\r\nYeah, that sounds like it's going to basically be a another rewrite of the entire proof engine?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/650776740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/650777776","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12524#issuecomment-650777776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12524","id":650777776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDc3Nzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-28T15:13:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T15:13:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> What strategy does the pretyper use?\r\n\r\nIt uses a dedicate environment structure that caches additional data inside.\r\n\r\n> What's the clenv?\r\n\r\nIt's the datatype that captures applications of lemmas of type `forall (x1 : X1) ...
