What about adding a special treatment in `Goptions.declare_bool_option` to register options starting with `Printing` (or, better, if we are not afraid of API incompatibilities, to have a dedicated `declare_printing_option`, or maybe even better, a label `~category` to `declare_bool_option`), so that `Set Printing All` sets them all at the same time, `Unset Printing All` unsets them all at the same time. Then, we could also have, say, a subcategory `Printing`/`Match` with new `Set Printing Match All`/`Unset Printing Match All` which would set/unset all printing options related to `match`, etc. Opinions of users about that?\r\n\r\nBTW, I would not set `Set Printing Goal Names`, `Set Printing Goal Tags`, `Set Printing Dependent Evars Line`, `Set Printing Unfocused` in the category of term printing. We would rather need another category of goal printing.\r\n\r\nBut, basically, the primary idea would be to have flags organized with more structure, i.e. to extend `declare_bool_option` to register categories and subcategories of options.\r\n\r\nOn the IDE side, the ideal I have in mind would be to have a window with checkboxes, and `all`/`none` buttons, maybe `invert` buttons, and so on...

This looks nice and clean to me.\r\n\r\nI agree with the distinction between `Defaults` and `All`. Formerly, `Unset Printing All` was basically going back to the default (in the absence of other `Set`/`Unset` in the meantime). So the new `Set Printing Defaults` is good. What should be the meaning of `Unset Printing All`? Now, it activates all sugaring strategies, even those which are not on by defaults (namely `Implicits Defensive` and `Projections`). I would need time to understand whether this is an intuitive terminology.\r\n\r\nI also have the following local remarks:\r\n- The `printing_record` field does not seem to be used. If related to the change in `pr_mutual_inductive_body`, I believe it is good like you did. There was a time where we thought at records as alias for inductive types, but I think that they now have a proper status as records (@mattam82, @aspiwack?) and that they should remain printed as records even when `Set Printing All` is on.\r\n- The \"enabled\" value of synth is wrong I think, it should be \"false\"\r\n- It seems that `REVERTCast` printing as well as the type of let-in (in detyping.ml) was governed only by `Set Printing All `and by no other individual option. What about adding a dedicated option for the both of them (say `Set Printing Hidden Casts`???) so as to control them individually too.\r\n- I believe that the `printing_all` protecting the `synth_type` should go away (since only the option `synth_type` shall now govern the corresponding line).\r\n\r\nWondering what others think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/363177999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/363197178","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6560#issuecomment-363197178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6560","id":363197178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzE5NzE3OA==","user":{"login":"psteckler","id":2244648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler","html_url":"https://github.com/psteckler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T19:38:30Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T19:38:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created #6698.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/363197178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/363198200","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6560#issuecomment-363198200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6560","id":363198200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzE5ODIwMA==","user":{"login":"psteckler","id":2244648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler","html_url":"https://github.com/psteckler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psteckler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T19:42:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T19:42:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@herbelin Wow, that was fast, even before I submitted the PR!
