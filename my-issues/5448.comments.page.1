Removing the [let v := (eval cbv \r\ndelta [P'] in P') in idtac v] gets rid of the stack overflow (removing [idtac \r\nv] does not).  Sorry it's so big; I've spun up my bug minimizer, but this is \r\none of those nasty bugs where copy-pasting the goal makes it go away, and where \r\nthe present goal relies on complicated definitions.  So I expect that any \r\nminimized example will still be a few thousand lines.\r\n\r\nPaul, could you take a look at this one, and see where the stack overflow is \r\ncoming from?  I suspect something is confused about either the context or the \r\nevar map regarding tactics in

The issue might be with cbv.  It might be with how Ltac talks to cbv.  It might be in Ltac.  I suspect that somehow [cbv] is seeing a term [a := a = a], and so it goes into a loop trying to unfold [a] (into [a = a] into [(a = a) = (a = a)] into ...).  Interestingly, when I use Hugo's cbv debug branch, the stack overflow occurs before cbv prints out that it's unfolding anything, so that's interesting.  I'd be curious to see a stack trace of the smaller example, if it's easy for you to make one.\n\nAnd perhaps Pierre-Marie will have an idea as to why this

author: @herbelin\n\nHi Paul, did you make some progress?\n\nI had a look at the \"fresh\" idempotency issue, and I suspect that for the \"cbv\" bug we are superimposing several bugs.\n\nOne of the bug is suspectingly an instance of the bug reported by Beta on coq-club \"Bug or feature?\" (Feb 3, 2017), this bug being itself a combination of  the absence of variables bound by indices in evars and of the shift of existing names introduced in v8.5 when a same name is added.\n\nA second issue is with the \"match goal\" which binds the \"a\" in \"forall a, a = a\" to \"a\" rather than say to \"a0\" (as printed), so as to avoid the collision with the \"a\" in the context. (I'm considering here the example in the comment number 30 below). I don't know if it should properly called a bug, but this is the cause of having both P' and P'' returning the same name a0.\n\nThen, there is obviously a bug in the transmission of the context to reduction tactics, as discussed in comment 33, and actually also to \"lazy\" and \"vm_compute\", since the stack overflow occurs also with these strategies.\n\nIf I try \"eval cbv delta [ a ] in P'\", I get an error (a not an evaluable reference). If I try \"eval cbv delta [ P'' ] in P'\" I got the stack overflow, as if P'', which should just be a name, like \"a\", seemed to be considered instead as a local definition \"a0:=a0\" or something like that.\n\nSo, first thing I would do would be to try to print what is the env passed to the function reduction.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552800","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5448#issuecomment-337552800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5448","id":337552800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MjgwMA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T15:29:53Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:59:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @psteckler\n\nFor the short example, each time the breakpoint at ln 268 is hit, the `env' argument to `cbv_stack_term' is consistently:\n\n  env: cbv_value Esubst.subs = ESID 0\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552801","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5448#issuecomment-337552801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5448","id":337552801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MjgwMQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T21:12:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:59:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @psteckler\n\n(In reply to Paul Steckler from comment [BZ#38](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%2338%22))\n> For the short example, each time the breakpoint at ln 268 is hit, the `env'\n> argument to `cbv_stack_term' is consistently:\n> \n>   env: cbv_value Esubst.subs = ESID 0\n\nHugo, does this constant environment make sense?\n\nSince we get the stack overflow with other reducers, where does the transfer of context take place?

by the degenerate match which should informally be something like\n\nnamed_context:\n\n a : nat\n\nrel_context:\n\n a : eq nat (Var a) (Var a)\n a := eq (eq nat (Var a) (Var a)) (Rel a) (Rel a) : Prop\n\nto the context used in the ltac:() quotation:\n\n [a1 : nat  a : eq nat a1 a1  a0 := eq (eq nat a0 a0) a a : Prop] []\n\nOne should instead find\n\n [a1 : nat  a : eq nat a1 a1  a0 := eq (eq nat a1 a1) a a : Prop] []\n\nSo, there seems to be a bug in Evarutil.push_rel_context_to_named_context.

The current situation is unstable as this bug or the inconsistency with instance printing (see https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/307) shows.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be wiser not to change existing names by side-effect?
