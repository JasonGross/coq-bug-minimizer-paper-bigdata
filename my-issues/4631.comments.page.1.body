Sometimes when I use [refine] to switch the order of arguments, Coq 8.5 stack overflows.

    The tactic interpreter now uses a new type of tactics, through
    the GTac module. A ['a Gtac.t] is a special case of tactic that
    may depend on the current goals, or not. Internally, it construct
    a list of results, one for each focussed goal, if the tactic is
    actually dependent.

    This allows for an interpretation of whole-goal tactic that does
    work, which was not the case for the previous implementation,
    which did to many Proofview.Goal.enter.

It looks like there is a cycle in the evar dependency of the term created by the refine tactic, leading to the stack overflow.

OK, I think I found the error. The `Evarutil.occur_evar_upto` function does not do what it claims. If an evar is undefined, it simply ignores its arguments for the occurs check. Fixing this bug makes your example fail. Was that the expected behaviour?


Comment author: @maximedenes

This is a part of the code base I don't know at all, but already for Termops.occur_evar, is it ok not to look into the arguments of evars? I understand it doesn't recursively check the evar_map, but still. For instance, Termops.occur_var does check evars arguments through Constr.iter.


Comment author: @ppedrot

Checking the arguments in case of an undefined evar is an overapproximation, as the argument may not be used by the body of the evar when it is instantiated. Yet, it is the only sound behaviour I can think of, as witnessed by the current bug. We could try to weaken the environment, but that would require typing and it may break things in a way difficult to predict.

No, the example goes through fine in 8.4pl6

I did no look at the example, but it is not the only sound solution as far as I can tell from your message.  Evars can be pruned (the Coq codebase calls restriction this way).
In particular you can say the evar cannot use its, say, second argument.
The "filter" data structure serves this purpose.

Eg.  occur_check  Y   (f (X a Y b))  -->  success, but X filtered on 2nd arg

Indeed, this is what I meant by "weakening the environment". But I think we start to wander on the fringes of heuristics with this approach. Where do we cut the cycle? How do we ensure that typing of the type of the evar is preserved? There may be several choices, leading to different solutions.

Yes, IIRC Matita was recursively restricting the type of the evar... and I had the impression Coq was doing the same.  But AFAICT evarconv did not change much, so it must be refine calling unification on a "harder" problem than before.
In any case we (Maxime and myself) plan to look at the code of refine this afternoon to understand how things are.

Enrico, Maxime, any further insights?

*** #5468 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***


I just stumbled on what looks like an instance of this issue:

```coq
Goal exists x, x = 0.
  eexists.
  match goal with |- ?x = _ =>
    refine ((fun (_ : x = x) => _) _)
  end.
(* Error: Stack overflow *)
```

Could someone confirm whether this is actually the same issue?
Note: the snippet above is derived from an attempt at doing what `eassert` does using `refine`, before finding out that `eassert` exists. However, `eassert` seems to behave correctly, as opposed to refine...
It seems all these examples are fixed by #7825.
