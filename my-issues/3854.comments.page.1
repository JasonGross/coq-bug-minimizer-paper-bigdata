These two \"changes\" of semantics are a consequence of the change of this order.\n\nI initially made this change for improving a small issue in naming existential variables. It happened that this change (and related ones) revealed a couple of bugs here and there. It happened that the order of resolution of problems crucially impacted type classes resolution, and, incidentally Program.\n\nWhat it is clear at this point is that the order of resolution of ?n1 = ?n2 unification problems impacts the order in which type classes instances are looked for. Consider e.g. the following ordered list of evars to solve using the type class mechanism.\n\n?n1 : T\n?m : U\n?n2 : T\n\nIf we do ?n1 := ?n2, then an instance for ?m is looked for first. If we do ?n2:=?n1, an instance for ?n1 is looked for first, which does not necessarily commutes.\n\nWhy the order of resolution of ?n1 = ?n2 unification problems impacts the success of type class inference is however yet unclear to me. Maybe this is the same reason as why it impacts Program, but it has to be investigated further (why Program is sensitive to the order of resolution of ?n1 = ?n2 problems is that evars have tags and that Program and type classes know only for some specific tags - for instance they do not consider named implicit arguments -, then, if we set ?n1 := ?n2, then it is the tag of ?n2 which is tested, if we otherwise do ?n2 := ?n1, it is the tag of ?n1 which is tested, and they might differ).\n\nMaybe should we revert the change in order of resolution of ?n1 = ?n2 problems while waiting for a better understanding of how to address the resolution of these problems in a less arbitrary way.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337528081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337528084","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3854#issuecomment-337528084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3854","id":337528084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyODA4NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-12T10:07:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:43:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment

author: @mattam82\n\nIndeed, Hugo made a change to unification that can result in a different order and different constraints being resolved by typeclasses and that's what you're seing here: it tries to resolve ?f : Foo ((fun X : Type => X) Set) instead of ?f' : Foo Set because it instantiates f' with f instead of the converse. Now there's no reason Foo ((fun X => X) Set) couldn't be solved, and indeed there was a bug in the discrimination tree used to index patterns and lookup hints based on their type that prevented the beta reduced instance to be found (fixed now).\n\nOn the order of resolution issue, yes the typeclass resolution uses the order given by fold_undefined to resolve classes.\nDo you think a canonical order could be used instead, like an order on user input locations of introductions of the evars (taking the min when merging two evars)? I suspect for Program, taking a kind of lub of the statuses (assuming QuestionMark is at the top) could be a solution too.\n\nResolution is not commutative for reordering in connected components of evars (w.r.t. dependency) which have non-unique solutions (typically for problems ?foo : Class ?A, ?bar : Class2 ?A with two couples of instances for Class(/2) nat and Class(/2) bool). In strict resolution mode, or if the argument of Class and Class2 is declared an input for Class and Class2 (using the new, undocumented (sorry) Hint Mode Class + : typeclass_instances for example), ?A is either frozen (strict resolution) or no resolution will happen as ?A contains an existential and is declared an input. This hopefully can make resolution much more predictable and solve this non-commutativity problem when the user registers the indexes correctly.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337528093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337528094","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3854#issuecomment-337528094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3854","id":337528094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyODA5NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-12T13:09:57Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:43:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @gares\n\nMy impressions is that the order in which these \"logic programs\" are run is important to make the whole thing programmable.
