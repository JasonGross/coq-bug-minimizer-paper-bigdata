So we currently have `Set Debug "Cbv"` and `Set Debug "RAKAM"`. Supposedly `RAKAM` prints debugging information for `simpl` and `cbn` but I am unable to understand what is going on.

It prints the successive states of the abstract machine and requires to know the syntax of the machine. It could be changed to print a more intelligible syntax.

As for doing something similar to `Set Debug "cbv"`, i.e. to prints something at unfolding of a constant, that'd be also possible.
