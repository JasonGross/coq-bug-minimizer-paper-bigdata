If this is indeed the case, it should also make the \"tree traversal\" linear in the size of the proof script.  The depth-first search/tree traversal is to find the diffs and then compare the evars used in the old and new expression.  If you already have the diffs then it would be linear.\r\n\r\nIf the proof term data structure is mutated (not typical in Coq code AFAIK), proof scripts would be linear; the diffs would be readily available, so the \"tree traversal\" could also be linear.\r\n\r\nI've not read this code, but a few things suggested to me that it's probably quadratic.  _In either case, the asymptotic complexity won't change._  If it is quadratic, that may not be detectable in your measurements because the constant is very small.  Copying a data structure and splicing in a few changes is, after all, quite simple.  It may only be measurable in scripts larger than the ones you tried.\r\n\r\nPerhaps @ppedrot knows how this code works?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/683463968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/683483180","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8481#issuecomment-683483180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8481","id":683483180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzQ4MzE4MA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-30T23:13:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T23:13:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The way proof terms are stored is that you maintain a map of holes/evars/goals to the terms that fill them; these terms themselves may contain holes.
