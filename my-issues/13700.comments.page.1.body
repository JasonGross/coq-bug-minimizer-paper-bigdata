FTR, many tactics perform βι normalization of the goal, not only `assert`. Trying to get rid of this behaviour has resulted in backwards incompatibility. The (arguable) argument is that in most cases, the βι-normal form is deemed more palatable than the non-normalized one. I tend to agree with it, since dummy β cuts are quite annoying.
I think there should be a distinction between low-level tactics and higher-level tactics, and they should have different defaults.  I'm fine with `rewrite` and `apply` and `assumption` being modulo beta (though I think even here things should be configurable unless the defaults can handle all use cases).  In any case, I think it should be documented which tactics perform which reductions.
