Dune in a sense is a bit similar to \"Nix-like\" approaches, when running something from Dune, `PATH` is set up in such a way that it simulates the environment you'd get when installing the package. So in fact, if you depend on `coqtop`, coqtop will be built and installed _first_, then used.\r\n\r\nWell, I took this choice, as you can also declare dependency on \"internal\", dev-only script. But my choice means that when the standard library is built, it is seeing `coqtop` as the installed one.\r\n\r\nThis is what makes Dune compositional, as no matter whether coqtop is provided locally
