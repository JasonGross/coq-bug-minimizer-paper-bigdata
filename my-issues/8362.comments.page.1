rationale here is that actually, in a pure dune build, all targets should effectively be already tested by dune's own test suite and coverage tools, so we can be relieved of this testing ourselves; at some point we should have 3 kind of targets:\r\n- targets native to dune: tested by Dune test suite\r\n- targets native to coq_makefile [stdlib build]: should be tested by coq_makefile test-suite\r\n- \"bureaucratic targets\" : indeed these targets should be tested, but IMHO this is doable as I think it is a quite reduced set of targets we need to care
