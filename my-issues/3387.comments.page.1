You're unifying a fresh type to Obj set_cat, that will always work. Then you're considering that fresh type as a pattern (so it's level is completely ignored afterwards, except it unified with that of y) used in change to find subterms to convert with the y. At this point the unification constraints makes it so that either the Type parameter of the equality or the two Type arguments can be converted with y but not both at the same time with the same y.
