Note that this is recent; I'm pretty sure it built fine in this environment as of c4ecec191130a51975bf97d067472e0e5bd744f5.

It is, indeed, due to Pierre-Marie PÃ©drots's 062d07eb5446, yesterday-ish which uses a [Lazy.is_val] which available only since 4.00.

I don't think having an [is_val] primitive on IStream warrants a bump in ocaml version (actually, I even believe that [is_val] is a unreasonable breach of abstraction and shouldn't be implemented even if we needed it).

I suggest that the commit be reverted. But I'll wait for Pierre-Marie's opinion before doing so.

Let's revert it indeed.
