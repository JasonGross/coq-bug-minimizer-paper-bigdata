It should be done after substitution.\n\nBy the way, the code of generalize is excessively convoluted for a tactic simple like this one. I believe it should basically be rewritten from scratch and extended so that it works:\n- by giving open subterms (e.g. \"generalize (S _)\")\n- supporting not only a \"at\" clause, but also a \"in\" clause, consistently with destruct\n- and more generally be connected to a unified mechanism for selecting subterms (whatever strategy, up to some amount of delta or not, is used), e.g. by resorting to an extension with a testing_function of subst_closed_term_occ, or by using the low-level features of rewrite_strat (to see with Matthieu what is the most relevant here).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546706","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5045#issuecomment-337546706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5045","id":337546706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NjcwNg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-30T16:20:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:39:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nFixed by 064de6f.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
