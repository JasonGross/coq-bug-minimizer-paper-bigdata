Superficially, It appears to you that A.X and A.Y live in the same namespace, but this is actually not the case, as the \"Locate\" command would tell you.\n\nMore generally, the principle underlying the Coq naming system is that you can always reach all defined terms through a fully qualified name. (There are exceptional cases where you can break this, but this is due to functors and in that case, Coq tends to become quite talkative about it). If you cannot do it, you'll run into trouble, because you won't be able to typecheck former expressions, as the names they depend on have disappeared. I know that this is a problem that plagued the OCaml community until recently. To ensure this safety property, you need to give a name to the module currently being built.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337532547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337532549","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4109#issuecomment-337532549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4109","id":337532549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzMjU0OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T09:43:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:55:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nAh, sorry, I was confused by the behavior of 8.4, which, unlike 8.5, says:\n\nModule Import A1.\n  Module A.\n  End A.\nEnd A1.\nModule Import A2.\n  Module A.\n    Locate Module A.
