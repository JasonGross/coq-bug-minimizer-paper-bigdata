I also think it is bad that the test-suite is dependent on git.\n\nMore generally, lots and lots of dependencies were added to the test-suite without care during this release. For instance, the test-suite is also dependent on python. It should probably be made into an optional dependency, that is if python is available the tests should run, if it is not, the tests should be skipped with a warning.\n\nIn the case of the coq_makefile tests though, I don't see how the use of git can be so important that it cannot be avoided.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337557465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/344540837","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5725#issuecomment-344540837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5725","id":344540837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDU0MDgzNw==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T09:49:37Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T09:49:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Re-targeting to 8.8 as in fact I believe that the test-suite was *not* dependent on git in 8.7, as the only occurrence of `git` in the test-suite is `git clean -dfx || true`.
