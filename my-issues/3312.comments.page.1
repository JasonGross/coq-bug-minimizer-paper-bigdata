In your example, [bar] should rewrite [0] into [1], but the goal to which [rewrite_strat bar] is being applied is [0=1].  On the other hand, [rewrite_strat (subterms bar)] does work correctly, at least in the recent trunk version of Coq.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519232","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3312#issuecomment-337519232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3312","id":337519232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTIzMg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-09T21:30:54Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:17:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nAh, I think I misunderstood how [rewrite_strat] worked at the time.
