Please note that IMHO failing at Qed should be morally considered as an anomaly, as it means you've been doing dirty things with tactics, which are reputed « safe » (whatever that may signify).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538413","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4464#issuecomment-337538413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4464","id":337538413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzODQxMw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T18:11:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:13:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\n> IMHO failing at Qed should be morally considered as an anomaly\n\nSure.  (Well, except for guardedness/productivity and modulo use of *_no_check tactics.)  I guess I view anomalies at Qed-time as somewhat less annoying than anomalies at tactic-running time.  Possibly because anomalies at tactic-running time are frequently things that should fail as errors rather than failing as anomalies, and so now I need to figure out a way to get my tactic script to notice the error before it happens.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538415","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4464#issuecomment-337538415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4464","id":337538415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzODQxNQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T16:44:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:13:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nFixed by d93e8a7.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337538415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
