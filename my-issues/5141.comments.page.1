I'm not sure whether the fix is to provide a more intelligent heuristic, or to rephrase slightly the error message. Indeed, 'type of pattern-matching' refers to the return type, not the type of the argument being matched.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337548240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337548241","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5141#issuecomment-337548241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5141","id":337548241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0ODI0MQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-16T17:07:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:44:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nFixed by 67c713c.
