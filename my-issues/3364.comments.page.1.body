On Windows, Timeout gives
Anomaly: Uncaught exception Invalid_argument("Sys.signal: unavailable signal").
Please report.

It would be nice if this could be fixed.  However, barring a miraculous fix, I would like to request a variant of the Timeout tactic, say, [PoorMansTimeout n tac], that executes [tac] fully, measuring how long it takes, and is equivalent to [fail "Timeout!"] if it takes longer than [n] seconds.

Fixed in trunk.
