This includes a patched version of lablgtk2 (that is the problem you see).  The patch was sent to the upstream author, but I don't know if it was integrated and/or a release including the patch made public.\n\nI'm attaching the script to build the SDK, ideally a prebuilt one should be distributed along with Coq.  It was testes a while ago, apologies if something does not work.  Could you test it? (It includes the patch for lablgtk2).\n\nIt should build a C:\\CoqSDK-0 directory and a CoqSDK-0.zip archive.\nOnce you have C:\\CoqSDK-0 in place, from a cygwin prompt you should type\n  . /cygdrive/c/CoqSDK-0/env\n(IIRC, maybe it is called environ) and then you should be able to build coq and coqide.  The env script sets environment variables like PATH and OCAMLLIB to the right value.\n\nCheers\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518515","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3275#issuecomment-337518515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3275","id":337518515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxODUxNQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-11T06:59:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @gares\n\nCreated attachment 456\nscript to build CoqSDK-0.zip\n\n> Attached file: [build-sdk-win.sh](https://coq.inria.fr/bugfiles/attachment.cgi?id=456) (application/x-sh, 7408 bytes)\n> Description:   script to build CoqSDK-0.zip\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518516","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3275#issuecomment-337518516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3275","id":337518516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxODUxNg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-12T06:16:52Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nEvery time I run the script, I get:\n$ ./build-sdk-win.sh\nChecking for wget\n/usr/bin/wget\nInstalling 7z, gcc, ... using cygwin\nCheck: 7z, gcc.
