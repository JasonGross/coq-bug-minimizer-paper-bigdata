I'd like to see a tactic for small inversions 
(http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/a-new-Coq-tactic-for-inversion/, 
http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~monin/Proof/SmallInvScalesUp/paper.pdf) make its 
way into the standard library.


@herbelin mentioned during the WG he's working on it (with Thierry Martinez), so assigning to him.
