This code works in 8.4pl6, but neither 8.5pl2 nor 8.6 with `Require Import Coq.Compat.Coq84.`
```
Section a.
  Context (x : Type).
  Definition foo : Type.
  Admitted.
End a.
Check foo : Type.
```
There should be a setting that restores the 8.4 behavior, which is set in Compat.Coq84.

Fixed by 12268be that introduces the `Keep Admitted Variables` option.
