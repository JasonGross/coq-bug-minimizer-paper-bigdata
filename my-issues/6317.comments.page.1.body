Hmmm, apparently `Set Keyed Unification` and `Declare Equivalent Keys` is not necessary to get the working code to work.  I guess `rewrite` is sometimes modulo Î´?  I am more confused.
But `Keyed Unification` is required in this case?
```coq
Parameter T : Set.
Parameter zero one: T.
Parameter f : T -> T -> option T.
Hypothesis f_unit : forall t, f zero t = None.

Definition g := f zero zero.

Set Keyed Unification.
Goal (g = None).
Proof.
  Fail rewrite f_unit.
  Declare Equivalent Keys g f.
  rewrite f_unit.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```

I remain confused.

Perhaps @ppedrot knows about this.
