actually I looked at the source code and I got a different picture from what I had read in the issues / PRs, sorry, I got it wrong.\r\nIndeed it is a long story but dune install has a bit of messy history.\r\n\r\nSee the code here https://github.com/ocaml/dune/blob/66982576945ca3e61ee7ac87f927bebcc17b271e/src/dune_engine/install.ml#L146-L167\r\n\r\nSo this is a dune bug, as it doesn't allow to set the docdir properly, bug report filed , I intend to fix this for 2.9 https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/4723\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the easiest thing for Debian packages to workaround this is to use opam-installer, or to fixup this file manually:\r\n```\r\ndune build -p coq-core,coq-stdlib,coq,coqide-server,coqide`\r\nsudo opam installer --prefix=.... --docdir=... coqide.install\r\n....\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/859049214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/875742238","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14467#issuecomment-875742238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14467","id":875742238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTc0MjIzOA==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T16:19:57Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T16:19:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Duplicate
