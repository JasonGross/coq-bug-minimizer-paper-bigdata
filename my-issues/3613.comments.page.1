The error message should mention [Proof using], and probably instruct the user as to how this error can be fixed by updating the [Proof using] list on such-and-such a line.  (e.g.,\n\"\"\"\nThe following section variable are used but not declared:\nua\nYou can either update your proof to not depend on ua, or you can update line nnn from\nProof using <existing
