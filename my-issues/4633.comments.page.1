I think a better error message would be either \"Error: Unknown existential variable.  Only user-given names for existential variables can be referenced.  To give a name to an existential, introduce it with the ?[name] syntax.\" or, if you want something shorter, \"Error: Existential variable unknown or not user-named.\"\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
