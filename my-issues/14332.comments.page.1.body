For now, try to avoid pressing "interrupt" twice, wait for the first one to return.
Indeed, waiting a while fixes the problem.  So this is low priority
Ah, oops, sorry, wrong issue to comment on
I believe this is already fixed.  I made a number of fixes/changes to avoid "coqtop died badly" some time ago.  If you find a new repeatable way to get this failure, let me know.
