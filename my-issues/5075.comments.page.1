Since \nCoq already has scopes, I propose the ability to bind modules to scopes, and \nautomatically import the qualified names (only the Gallina identifiers, not the \ntactics, nor the coercions, and probably not the instances, but maybe the \nnotations) for the duration of that scope.  Another alternative would be \nsomething like [(expression)%%Module.Name] to bring the identifiers into scope.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547111","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5075#issuecomment-337547111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5075","id":337547111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NzExMQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T12:48:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:40:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @maximedenes\n\nPMP, do you know how hard it would be to implement this?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547112","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5075#issuecomment-337547112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5075","id":337547112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NzExMg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T15:07:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:40:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nI would say quite easy.
