This contrasts with the internal representation of `match` where all subterms of `fun yi x => P` and of `fun xij => tj` are subterms of the `match`, even though the types of `yi`, `x` and `xij` are canonically derivable from the type of `t`, and even though there are not explicit in the concrete syntax.\r\n\r\nIt is long time ago that changing the internal representation of the return predicate and of the branches of a `match` has been discussed (probably more than 10 years ago). At some time, Benjamin Grégoire had almost something working but for some reason, it did not converge.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best way to ensure this notion of subterm is to change the internal representation of terms.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to change only the iter/fold/map/etc combinators over terms, which by the way could be done step by step.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think this is not of the \"bug fix\" kind but of the \"design\" kind issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516553","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3166#issuecomment-337516553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3166","id":337516553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxNjU1Mw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-23T23:01:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:09:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @maximedenes\n\nJust out of curiosity, isn't there some flexibility in the domains of lambdas in return clauses with universe subtyping?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516554","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3166#issuecomment-337516554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3166","id":337516554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxNjU1NA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-20T18:01:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T23:10:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\r\n\r\nMaxime, that does seem to be the case, though I'm not sure what the flexibility could be useful for...\r\n\r\nSee, e.g.,\r\n```coq\r\nUniverse i j.\r\nAxiom admit : False.\r\nSet Printing Universes.\r\nGoal forall (A : Type@{i}) (x y : Type@{i}) (X : x) (p : x = y) (P : _ -> Prop),\r\nP match p in (_ = y') return y' with\r\n| eq_refl => X\r\nend.\r\nintros.\r\nchange Type@{i} with Type@{j}.\r\nchange (fun (y' : ?T) (y'' : eq x y') => @ ?B y' y'') with\r\n(fun (y' : T) (y'' : eq x y') => (fun (y' : T) (y'' : eq x y') => B y' y'') y' y'').

the inductive types by substitution of the parameters of the inductive types.\n\nThe drawback is that one would need typing the matched term in order to build the typing environment of the predicate and branches of a \"match\" and it remains to be evaluated whether it would not be to difficult to implement.\n\nThe clear advantage of this approach is that one would get an internal representation

author: @silene\r\n\r\nI am not sure to understand. Why would it be harder to type a return clause `(fun (p:?1) (x:I p) => f p x : ?2)` than to type a return clause `(f _1 _2 : ?2)` with `(_1:?1) (_2:I _1)` for an inductive type `I`? It seems to me we have exactly the same information and that, in both cases, we might have to type the matched term in order to deduce `?1` if it is not readily apparent from `?2`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516560","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3166#issuecomment-337516560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3166","id":337516560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxNjU2MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T06:08:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:09:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nSorry, obviously I meant it the other way.

In one case, the pretyper-inferred types are remembered, while in the other case, the typechecker has to infer them anew.
