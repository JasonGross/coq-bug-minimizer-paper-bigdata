I even tried adding more iterations. While performances slowly degrade, the situation is nowhere as exponential as yours (more like quadratic). After a few more iterations, it takes about one second per iteration. That said, as far as I can tell, most of the time is wasted in the OCaml runtime managing its internal data structures for dynamic linking. So it might well depend on your OCaml compiler. Mine is 4.04.0.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337556196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337556199","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5678#issuecomment-337556199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5678","id":337556199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NjE5OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-24T20:03:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:10:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nStrange.
