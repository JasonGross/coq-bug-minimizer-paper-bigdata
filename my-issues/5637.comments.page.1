author: @psteckler\n\nThe lexer spec contains:\n--\nlet proof_start =\n  \"Theorem\" | \"Lemma\" | \"Fact\" | \"Remark\" | \"Goal\" | \"Correctness\" | \"Obligation\" | \"Next\"\n--\nwhich explains the behavior.\n\nFrom the \"Solving Obligations\" section of the manual, it looks like the keyword \"Obligation\" can start a proof in two ways:\n\n- Obligation num [of ident]\n- Next Obligation [of ident]\n\nSo the lexer should be looking for those.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337555638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337555639","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5637#issuecomment-337555639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5637","id":337555639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NTYzOQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T19:19:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:08:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
