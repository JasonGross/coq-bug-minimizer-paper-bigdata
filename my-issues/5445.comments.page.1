I think that it should be possible to use nsatz over fields without loading up all of the machinery about reals.  At the bare minimum, the plugin should be declared in a file that doesn't load any axioms.  Preferably, the tactics should be, too.  Maybe add an Nsatz_tactic.v file that defines all the the tactics, but doesn't load anything about reals, and is exported by Nsatz.v\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552709","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5445#issuecomment-337552709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5445","id":337552709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MjcwOQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-08T15:58:58Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:58:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nThat's probably the way to go indeed.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337552709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
