Indeed, many parts of the code of setoid_rewrite expects that the relation you're rewriting on is indeed a relation, i.e. of type A -> A -> Type for some A.\n\nHere, you're rewriting over the relation b : String0 -> nat -> bool, which is not a relation actually. In simple cases like yours, the tactic could succeed, but I think that in more involved examples, it would have produced an anomaly just as before.\n\nWhat do the authors of setoid_rewrite think about this?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540545","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4596#issuecomment-337540545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4596","id":337540545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MDU0NQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-28T12:43:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:19:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nFixed by db2c6f0.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540546","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4596#issuecomment-337540546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4596","id":337540546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MDU0Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-28T20:24:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nThanks!\n\nI think the spec should not be changed between pl versions, and it would be nice to have the -compat 8.5 / -compat 8.4 flags preserve the current behavior.

Apparently setoid_rewrite \"through rewrite\" is buggy since 8.4 at least in this respect, allowing unresolved evars corresponding to arguments to the lemma to remain. I think this should be fixed but don't know how (there's no interface in Clenv do to that, but it should be easy, PMP?). To remain backwards compatible seems safe for the next pl1, but not in the long run (I have this noted for the upcoming cleanup of rewrite/setoid_rewrite).\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540550","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4596#issuecomment-337540550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4596","id":337540550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MDU1MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T17:27:00Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nThe rewrite/setoid_rewrite cleanup should happen on trunk, not on v8.5.
