The fact that coq_makefile generates makefiles that use $* rather than $< means that I get a warning like the following on every file:

<unknown>Warning: File "./src/ADTRefinement/Refinements" has been implicitly
expanded to
"./src/ADTRefinement/Refinements.v" [file-no-extension,filesystem]

Fixed by commit 37293bd. Thanks for the report.
