You can clear the messages when you're at the debugger prompt.  FWIW, 8.13 doesn't let you explicitly clear the Messages panel, though it's not an issue because there's much less output and it is (still) cleared for each new sentence sent to Coq.

The popup menu is generated by GTK, not OCaml code AFAIK, which limits what can be done with a reasonable effort.
