For the record, the `nat_ind` case is addressed in #12996 which requires some time though.
I'm not sure more flexibility is what we need, as opposed to more consistency and complete docs...
I.e., it's already pretty hard to document the current state and it feels like it is going to be even harder if we introduce more flexibility.
