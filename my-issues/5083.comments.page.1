author: @gares\n\nI thought about that more, and no, it can't be fixed.\n\nReset placed in the middle of a proof has 2 effects:\n- runs in the worker\n- runs in master\n\nMaster accumulates results coming from the worker.\nDepending on the interleaving, the Reset on master may run before or\nafter the results are received.  So I've no way to give a deterministic\nmeaning to \"Reset\" in the middle of a proof with the current semantics of\ncommands occurring into proofs.\n\nA semantics that is implementable (but not for 8.6) is that\nif you place it in a proof, then it only affects \"Show Ltac...\"\nthat occur in the proof.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337547218","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5083#issuecomment-337547218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5083","id":337547218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NzIxOA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T21:09:27Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:41:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nWhat about recording a set of state ids that had a [Reset Ltac Profile] \nassociated with them, in the same way that you record which state ids have \nprofiling data associated with them?
