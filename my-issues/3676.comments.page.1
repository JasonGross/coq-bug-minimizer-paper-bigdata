I'm trying to recreate the directory [foo] in a file [foo.v], so that the namespace [foo] consists of some definitions (included from various files in foo/), together with some modules (which are files in foo/).  I want it to be the case that if you [Require Top.foo. Include Top.foo], you get all of the definitions I want exposed, and you also get new names for all of the modules in foo/ that I'm trying to present.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337525052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337525055","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3676#issuecomment-337525055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3676","id":337525055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyNTA1NQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-13T13:46:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:34:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @maximedenes\n\nThis anomaly is now a regular error, so I'm closing the bug.
