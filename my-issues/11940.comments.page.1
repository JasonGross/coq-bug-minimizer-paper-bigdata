I have no idea why this would be the case, though...\r\n\r\nYou have more info in the discussion linked in the PR; it turns out that some C `sig_*` family of types are a POSIX level higher than what `--std=c99` does require. Thus if you force compliance they go out of scope. `--std=gnu99` which OCaml uses, does include the right POSIX functions.\r\n\r\nIn a sense we where accidentally overriding the default set of OCaml flags with a more restrictive one.\r\n\r\n(*) technically OCaml is using a range of `>= --std=gnu99` as it uses the gcc default which for more modern versions is as high as `gnu11` etc...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/605384319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/605420513","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11940#issuecomment-605420513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/11940","id":605420513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTQyMDUxMw==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-28T09:44:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-28T09:44:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Saw this in the bench https://ci.inria.fr/coq/job/benchmark-part-of-the-branch/899/console\r\n(based on commit before merge of #11809) \r\nWhy didn't we see it before though?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/605420513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/605449065","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11940#issuecomment-605449065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/11940","id":605449065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTQ0OTA2NQ==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-28T13:42:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-28T13:42:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Different compilers / libc versions likely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/605449065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
