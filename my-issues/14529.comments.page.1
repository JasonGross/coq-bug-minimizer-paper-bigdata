I guess I can try to adjust the minimizer to have a variant of module inlining where it simultaneously absolutizes all references to constants in the given module with new names...\r\n\r\nBut in fact the best solution to my headaches with the bug minimizer would be to grant https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4455, allowing something like `AbsoluteModuleDirectory Foo.Bar.Baz.` which has the effect of setting the path component of the DirPath.t of anything inside of it (perhaps only `Module`s should be allowed) to `Foo.Bar.Baz`, mimicking the ability to have a directory structure inside of a
