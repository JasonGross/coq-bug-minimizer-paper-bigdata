From where are you installing the package? From the main `opam-repository` I suppose? The CoqIDE package depends on `conf-adwaita-icon-theme` which, according to https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/conf-adwaita-icon-theme/conf-adwaita-icon-theme.1/opam, should ensure that `adwaita-icon-theme` is installed on Ubuntu. Do you mean that this package should be fixed to install `adwaita-icon-theme-full` instead? In any case, that's probably an issue to report to the opam-repository maintainers at https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues.
CoqIDE, at least, requires `adwaita-icon-theme-full`.  I'm not sure whether this means that we need a separate conf package, or if the existing conf package should be changed, but certainly one of these needs to happen.
OK. That's really something to ask the opam-repository maintainers. I don't think we can decide for them.
