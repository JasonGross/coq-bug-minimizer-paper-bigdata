Presumably this is due to #8743, switch to zarith; cc @ejgallego 
`zarith` version _must_ be >= 1.10 , likely that's the issue.

We should improve configure to check version numbers.
```
Unpacking libzarith-ocaml (1.5-1) ...
```
yeah, that's way too old and buggy.
Okay, I'll backport a newer version of zarith, thanks.  And, indeed, the configure script should check the version number better.
