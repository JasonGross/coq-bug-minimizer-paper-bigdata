No strong opinion on this, although indeed it may be better to have a uniform naming scheme. FTR, the `votour` name is a pun in French, as it is pronounced the same as *vautour*, which means *vulture*. We could also have picked a more meaningful coq-based name instead, like `coqobjdump` or something.
