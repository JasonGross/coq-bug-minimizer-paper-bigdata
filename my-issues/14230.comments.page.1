I think the rest of the tactics live on a spectrum.  For `simpl` and `cbn`, for example, I expect that we do want to normalize parameters, because these tactics are more about making the end result look pretty to the user, and are not used for complete reduction.  For `cbv` and `lazy`, I can see arguments in both directions.  Like `vm_compute` and `native_compute`, they do complete reduction, which is not very useful for function-typed parameters.  Like `simpl` and `cbn`, they are sometimes used to make the goal more understandable.  Furthermore, there are some cases where you want to normalize function-typed parameters, for example if you're going to use `constr_eq` to compare the types of hypotheses and you need to be sure that they are normalized similarly.  It's going to be very confusing if `cbv [foo] in *` does not unfold `foo` even when `unfold foo in *` does and moreover a tactic fails because `foo` is unfolded in one hypothesis but not another.  (This is not a concern for `vm_compute` and `native_compute` which, even if they took whitelists of identifiers to unfold, would not be very useful for unfolding in hypotheses because they leave behind no casts.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/856858861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
