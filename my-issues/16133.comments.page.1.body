This is very tricky to do unfortunately. Even manually adding the hints to core is not so straightforward. The FSets library requires a lot of work since it relies mostly on these hints being in core. As there are several sets of such instances around it will take some work to find out which ones are needed.
It should not be so hard.  Simply create a new db `structures` or `fsets` or something, add these hints to that db, and replace every invocation of `intuition`, `firstorder`, `auto`, and `eauto` with the corresponding invocation that uses both `core` and `strucutres`.  Or make the hints `#[export]` rather than `#[global]`, stick them in a `Module Export Hints` inside `IsEqOrig`, and then import all of the `Hints` modules before any proof that breaks.
I'll try your second suggestion later.
