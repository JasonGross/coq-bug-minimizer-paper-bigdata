I am doing some extensions to the real analysis library and trying to do the proofs nicely the derivable dependency of derive sometimes really seems to confuse Coq for no obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nWith doing proofs nicely I mean that instead of asserting tons of absolutely unintuitive stuff before applying a lemma with 10 premises I use unshelve eapply and let Coq tell me what it needs to apply the lemma. This way the proofs are much shorter, more obvious with a nice uncluttered context, but sometimes this breaks apart. Whatever I try I end up in the issues outlined by @JasonGross above or in \"Application of lemmas whose beta-iota normal form contains metavariables deep inside the term is not supported; try \"refine\" instead.\" Looks like the good old \"yes Coq is dependently typed, but don't use it\" story.\r\n\r\nIf this is of interest I could post the lemma I am working on - a variant of derive_pt_recip_interv for decreasing functions and proven based on the variant for increasing functions rather than from scratch. A proof from scratch works fine but needs a ton of upfront boilerplate lemmas. Proving the lemma depending on the increasing variant in the style common on the analysis library (provide 10 asserts of several lines long terms upfront) also works. Doing the proofs in a reasonable straight forward way letting Coq help you doesn't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/582308851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
