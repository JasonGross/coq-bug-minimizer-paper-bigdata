The current status quo already seems to be \"opam or roll your own\". And the \"roll your own\" option seems to be rather popular, suggesting that the opam solution isn't really satisfactory: see the reliance on Ubuntu packages in this issue, my use of `coq-bootstrap.sh` for test runners, the use of docker at https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7753#issuecomment-435020668, and the folklore of \"just build coq from git\" (e.g. in fscq).\r\n\r\nHere are two guesses for the reason: quite objectively, opam build times are just good enough for CI. More subjectively, my experience suggests would be unwise to put more faith in the maintainers of opam than in the Debian packagers of ocaml packages. A further requirement that I forgot before and that seems to be not that well met by common usage of opam is running multiple coq versions at the same time without interference.\r\n\r\nFurther, somehow we manage to distribute pre-compiled packages for Windows, so is it really inherently hard, or is it just that packaging for Linux has not received the amount of attention as packaging for Windows? In the worst case, we could bundle glibc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/437454060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/437463522","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8941#issuecomment-437463522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8941","id":437463522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ2MzUyMg==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T19:09:44Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T19:09:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I mean the binary packages should be generated by the combination of the dune build and opam for dependencies using a local switch.\r\n\r\nTho, support for vensoring in dune is improving fast so it could be the case that we can do without opam, but that would involve dunerizi g all the deps .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/437463522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/437463988","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8941#issuecomment-437463988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8941","id":437463988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ2Mzk4OA==","user":{"login":"andres-erbsen","id":918403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODQwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen","html_url":"https://github.com/andres-erbsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andres-erbsen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T19:11:23Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T19:11:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, that makes sense.
