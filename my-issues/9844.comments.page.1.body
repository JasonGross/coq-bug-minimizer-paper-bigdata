Ah, it turns out this is already documented:
```rst
   .. exn:: Unexpected term @term while parsing a numeral notation.

     Parsing functions must always return ground terms, made up of
     applications of constructors and inductive types.  Parsing
     functions may not return terms containing axioms, bare
     (co)fixpoints, lambdas, etc.
```
Oh, erg, this only documents the parsing part.  I will document the printing part as well.
