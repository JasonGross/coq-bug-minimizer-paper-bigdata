Trying to get rid of this behaviour has resulted in backwards incompatibility. The (arguable) argument is that in most cases, the βι-normal form is deemed more palatable than the non-normalized one. I tend to agree with it, since dummy β cuts are quite annoying.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/753041607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/753049696","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/13700#issuecomment-753049696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/13700","id":753049696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzA0OTY5Ng==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-31T19:48:29Z","updated_at":"2020-12-31T19:48:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think there should be a distinction between low-level tactics and higher-level tactics, and they should have different defaults.  I'm fine with `rewrite` and `apply` and `assumption` being modulo beta (though I think even here things should be configurable unless the defaults can handle all use cases).  In any case, I think it should be documented which tactics perform which reductions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/753049696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
