(I was referring to the fact that `unfold` does not fail if the constant does not occur. @Zimmi48: A warning could indeed be generated though if the constant does not occur.)\r\n\r\nBack to the current issue, I'm proposing the following:\r\n1. add a new `evaluable_ref` tactic argument type which\r\n  - parses exactly what `unfold` parses, namely a \"smart qualid\" (i.e. a qualid or a notation string denoting a qualid)\r\n  - is globalized and interpreted exactly like the argument to `unfold`\r\n2. change the manual to say that it is `evaluable_ref` which is like `unfold`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, here are questionable issues with `unfold A`:\r\n-  the unfoldability of `A` is done both statically and dynamically. Shouldn't it be done only dynamically? For instance:\r\n   ```coq\r\n   Opaque id.\r\n   Fail Ltac f := unfold id.\r\n   Transparent id.\r\n   Ltac f := unfold id.\r\n   Goal id 0 = 0.\r\n   Opaque id.\r\n   Fail f.\r\n   Transparent id.\r\n   f.\r\n   ```\r\n   → I propose to remove the static check and to keep only the dynamic check.\r\n\r\n- In the same vein, should `Ltac f := unfold A` fails if `A` is an axiom. If `A` is an axiom in the argument of a functor, it may become dynamically an unfoldable constant. So, it should not be forbidden. What to do similarly if `A` is an inductive type or a constructor. Should the failure be detected statically or dynamically?\r\n\r\n   In Ltac2 `unfold A` is accepted statically for any (global) `A` and rejected for non-evaluable `A` only dynamically. In Ltac2, local definitions have to be referred to using `&`.\r\n   ```coq\r\n   From Ltac2 Require Import Ltac2.\r\n   Ltac2 f () := unfold Some.
