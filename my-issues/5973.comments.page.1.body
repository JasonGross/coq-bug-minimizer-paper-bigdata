I'm not sure I follow. Those archives correspond to tags, and we never modify them. So why do you need that information?
I guess I could instead condition on whether or not the file exists when grabbing sources.
If your goal is to grab the tarball of the sources then indeed, they are automatically generated by Coq based on the tag so they will never change (apart possibly the data-compression ratio if GitHub suddenly decides to, but then our sha512 would be broken so someone could detect this).
Ok, so I'll close this issue.
