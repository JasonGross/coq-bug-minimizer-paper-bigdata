I would like the error message to also have something such as 'In a subterm, could not unify given term \"nat\" with expected term \"Set\"', or similar.  I recall there recently being a fix that reprinted terms in such error messages with [Set Printing All] if they were equivalent, but this does not help with confusing error messages such as\n\nThe term \"A\" has type\n \"@ Adjunction (* Top.695 Top.696 Top.697 Top.698 Top.699 Top.700 Top.701\n    Top.717 Top.718 Top.719 Top.720 Top.721 *) H C D F G\"\nwhile it is expected to have type\n \"@ Adjunction (* Top.756 Top.757 Top.758 Top.759 Top.760 Top.761 Top.762\n    Top.763 Top.764 Top.765 Top.766 Top.767 Top.768 Top.769 Top.770 Top.771\n    Top.772 *) H C D F G\".\n\n(https://github.com/HoTT/coq/issues/56).
