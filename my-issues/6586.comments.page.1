Probably a variant of #4617 anyways. If it is the same bug I'm thinking about, this is due to an incompleteness of type-based solution refinement when the type is an evar (e.g. we except a product to be refined but we find an evar instead, so we should define it as a product first). I need to check this in details though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/357779179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
