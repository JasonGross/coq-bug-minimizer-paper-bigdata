Consider this:
$ echo 'Set Silent.
Check True.
Theorem a : True.
Unset Silent.
Proof I.' | coqtop
Welcome to Coq jgross-Leopard-WS:/home/jgross/Downloads/coq/coq-trunk,trunk

Coq <

Error: Attempt to save an incomplete proof (in proof a)

a <

Yet this is what happens if I step up to the end of [Proof I.] in PG, because 
it wants the most recent command to not be silent.  This is a regression since 
8.4, introduced in 8.5.  On the other hand the following was also valid in 8.4, 
and it's not clear to me that it should be valid (though the error message 
"Error: Attempt to save an incomplete proof (in proof a)" is certainly wrong):
Theorem a : True -> True.
  intro H.
  Proof H.

Jason, it seems that you are giving us each day a new reason for getting rid of this command ^^


Comment author: @ejgallego

Indeed, you are pointing out deeper issues than I thought; I am starting to thing that the burden of having this command is gonna be higher than the benefits; we can deprecate it in 8.7 [should be easy to add warning] and remove in 8.8.

The first bug is deeper than that. Basically, inserting any option command between Theorem and Proof seems broken...


Comment author: @ejgallego

Raising to blocker as action wrt this vernacular has to be taken before 8.7 (either fixing it or deprecating it).


Comment author: @psteckler

With 8.5 and 8.6, I can reproduce the error by sending the script through a shell pipe to coqtop.

If I add the -emacs flag to coqtop, though, I don't get the error message. And using vanilla PG with 8.5 or 8.6, which uses that flag, I don't see the error message (but the bug report appears to suggest otherwise).

With PG/xml and 8.5/8.6, I see the error message.

> but the bug report appears to suggest otherwise

Yeah, I could have sworn that I got this error message from within PG and was really confused by it.  I can't seem to reproduce that part, now.


Comment author: @psteckler

With trunk, the error message appears regardless of whether the -emacs flag appears, and indeed, appears when using vanilla PG.

Jason, can I guess you were using trunk, and not 8.6, when you saw the error in PG?

> can I guess you were using trunk, and not 8.6, when you saw the error in PG?

Oh, yeah, probably.


Comment author: @psteckler

Another data point: in 8.4pl6, there is no error message, regardless of whether the -emacs flag is given. 

Summary:

  8.4    : no error
  8.5/8.6: error only if -emacs flag not given
  trunk  : error independent of -emacs flag


Comment author: @ejgallego

Th√©o should we just deprecate this command?


Comment author: @Zimmi48

Yeah, let's deprecate it in 8.7. The deprecation notice should list "Proof. exact term. Qed." as an alternative and maybe I'll propose something better in 8.8.


Comment author: @ejgallego

Why not "Lemma .... := term" as done for definitions ?


Comment author: @ejgallego

That form can be implemented without any change to internal structures I believe.


Comment author: @Zimmi48

Indeed, that's what I'm aiming for.


Comment author: @ejgallego

Well, I had a brief look and indeed the internal representation would need some deeper changes than what I thought, however IMHO it is really worth unifying Theorem/Definition in 8.8.


It was blocker for 8.7...
