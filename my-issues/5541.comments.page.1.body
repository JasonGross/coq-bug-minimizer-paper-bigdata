I'd like an option telling Coq to not erase [Prop]s, as a work-around to 
https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5540.  (It also seems like it might 
be independently useful.)

Another thought/request: a mode where all Props are extracted to __, rather 
than being fully erased.

This would be most useful when extracting modules or module functors.
