If .cmxs files do not have the execute bit set (at least on Windows), attempting to use them results in "Error: error loading shared library: Permission denied".  The natdynlink target should use install -m 0755, not 0644.

Thanks for the report.
Sorry, I don't have a Windows, Is there the same issue with cma in byte mode ?
