I shall investigate whether these useless `s` and `s0` really need to be there, and/or whether these useless `s` and `s0` really needs to break the factorization algorithm.\r\n\r\nI shall not have a lot of time in the short term, so remind it to me within a few weeks if nothing happened on my side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/392595928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
