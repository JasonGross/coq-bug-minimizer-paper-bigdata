For example, I can write the following code.\n\nSet Printing Universes.\nInductive foo (A B : Type) := Foo : A -> B -> foo A B.\nDefinition foo' (A B : Type) := foo B A.\nCheck foo. (* Type (* Top.1 *) -> Type (* Top.2 *) -> Type (* max(Top.1, Top.2) *) *)\nCheck foo'. (* Type (* Top.7 *) -> Type (* Top.8 *) -> Type (* max(Top.8, Top.7) *) *)\nCheck foo nat nat. (* Set *)\nCheck foo' nat nat. (* Type (* max(Top.8, Top.7) *) *)\n\nGiven that [foo'] isn't much different from [foo], it would be really nice if the last of these gave me [Set].\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511267","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/2840#issuecomment-337511267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/2840","id":337511267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxMTI2Nw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-06T10:08:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T08:54:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\n\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug [BZ#2298](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%232298%22) ***\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337511267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
