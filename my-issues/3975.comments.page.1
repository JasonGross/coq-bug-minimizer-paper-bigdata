The libobjects\n     are retrieved later from this module path and substituted, typically\n     during a Require. This allows to vastly decrease vo size (up to 50%\n     on some files in the stdlib). More work is done during load (some\n     substitutions), but the extra time overhead appears to be negligible.\n    \n     Beware: all subst_function operations should now be\n     environment-insensitive, since they may be arbitrarily delayed.\n     Apparently only subst_arguments_scope had to be adapted.\n    \n     A few more remarks:\n    \n     - Increased code factorisation between modules and modtypes\n     - Many errors and anomaly are now assert\n     - One hack : brutal access of inner parts of module types\n      (cf handle_missing_substobjs)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337530136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337530138","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3975#issuecomment-337530138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3975","id":337530138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzMDEzOA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-12T13:56:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:49:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
