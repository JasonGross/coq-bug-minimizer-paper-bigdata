Would you be willing to help us a bit more by installing 8.4pl4 on your computer, as well as the current 8.4 version, so as to have reports even more informative?\n\nTo avoid having different coqtop/coqc/coqide in your path, you can configure with option -local, so that you can then just directly refer to coqc/coqtop in the bin subdirectory of the compilation directory.\n\nThanks for helping.\n\nHugo\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524613","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3647#issuecomment-337524613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3647","id":337524613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyNDYxMw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-03T12:31:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:32:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nFixed in trunk and branch 8.4.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
