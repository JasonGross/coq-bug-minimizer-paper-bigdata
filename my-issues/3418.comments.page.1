This is a \"quick\"\nchange for a serious worry which sometimes manifests into a real\ntyping bug.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the fix breaks a couple of scripts which do not\nshow incorrect typing, but I/we don't have a better fix at the current\ntime.\n\nI forgot to document the change. Now it is done. Thanks.\n\nHugo\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337520843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337520846","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3418#issuecomment-337520846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3418","id":337520846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMDg0Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-13T17:10:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:22:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nI assume you actually meant https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=2996, as per  the commit message.
