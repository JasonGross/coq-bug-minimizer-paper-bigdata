I should be able to step through this:

Class A := {}.
Ltac foo := idtac; idtac; idtac; idtac; idtac; idtac; constructor.
Hint Extern 0 A => foo : typeclass_instances.
Goal A.
  Set Ltac Debug.
  exact _.

(The relevant test for the output test-suite would stick [Set Ltac Batch Debug] 
in there as well.)

Strange, as if the debugging breakpoints put in tacinterp.ml were deactivated in hints. To be investigated.
