Where "> 25 minutes" might mean "forever".  Also, a recent commit broke many things; the test-suite now gives me:

Seems fixed in trunk.

It was fixed for me, and now it seems open again in trunk.

For the record, my current tip is

commit 0dfaecc2de2306ff9674a4aa3e546d3123015169
Author: Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot <pierre-marie.pedrot@ inria.fr>
Date:   Sun Jun 8 20:39:58 2014 +0200

    Moving hook code from Future to Lemmas. This seemed to disrupt compilation of
    the checker, and it was not used before that anyway.


Comment author: @ppedrot

It passes like 75% in List.memq because universe polymorphism seems to generate more universes, and displays a quadratic or so behaviour. My patch for imperative graph traversal in Univ does divide by 4 the time needed to compile Nsatz. I am waiting a bit to commit it, in order to leave time to Matthieu to clean this file up so that we can put a copy of it in the checker directory.
