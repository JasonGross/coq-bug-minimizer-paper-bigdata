But the problem remains in this example.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337546142","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5004#issuecomment-337546142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5004","id":337546142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0NjE0Mg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T17:06:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:37:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nIt is really a matter of how you write your definitions:\n\nIf I input the following definitions, it doesn't terminate, neither with Coq 8.5 nor Coq 8.6.\n\nDefinition foo' (d2Z := 16295367250680780974490674513165176452449235426866156013048779062215315747161%Z : Z)\n     (ls := (26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: nil)%list%Z)\n     (k := @ length Z (limb_widths_from_len' 10 255) : nat)\n     (e : (10 = 10)%nat)\n  := @ from_list Z k (encode' ls d2Z k) e.\nTime Definition foo'' := Eval vm_compute in foo'.\n\nBut if I input the following ones, it does terminate instantly, with both Coq 8.5 and 8.6.\n\nDefinition foo' (d2Z := 16295367250680780974490674513165176452449235426866156013048779062215315747161%Z : Z)\n     (ls := (26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: 26 :: 25 :: nil)%list%Z)\n     (k := @ length Z (limb_widths_from_len' 10 255) : nat)\n     (e : (10 = 10)%nat) : (Z * Z * Z * Z * Z * Z * Z * Z * Z * Z)%type\n  := @ from_list Z k (encode' ls d2Z k) e.\nTime Definition foo'' := Eval vm_compute in foo'.\n\nThe only difference between the two scripts is whether I gave a reduced type for foo' or not.
