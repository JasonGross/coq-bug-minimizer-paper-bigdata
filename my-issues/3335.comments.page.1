On Linux, %U makes far more sense.  It would be nice if Windows Coq could be distributed with its own working `time` command that it used in the makefile, and/or were compiled so that cygwin's `time` command worked.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519577","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3335#issuecomment-337519577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3335","id":337519577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTU3Nw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-27T16:30:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:18:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @gares\n\nMarking as enhancement since the bug is not really in Coq, but rather in cygwin and/or the hostile OS.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/813039288","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3335#issuecomment-813039288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3335","id":813039288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzAzOTI4OA==","user":{"login":"ejgallego","id":7192257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego","html_url":"https://github.com/ejgallego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejgallego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-04T14:07:05Z","updated_at":"2021-04-04T14:07:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is this still an issue?
