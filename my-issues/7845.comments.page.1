When there exists a `-R` flag, the `-R . Top` flag is correctly added to the beginning of the list.  However, when there are only `-Q` flags, the `-R . Top` flag takes precedence.  I'll open a new issue with the more general form of this problem.  In any case, here are test-cases:\r\n\r\nThe following works:\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir -p theories; touch a.v theories/b.v; (echo 'Require Import Foo.b.' > a.v)\r\ncoq_makefile -R theories Foo a.v theories/b.v -o Makefile\r\nmake clean && make\r\n```\r\nThe following should work, but does not:\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir -p theories; touch a.v theories/b.v; (echo 'Require Import Foo.b.' > a.v)\r\ncoq_makefile -Q theories Foo a.v theories/b.v -o Makefile\r\nmake clean && make\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/404100509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
