It works because you only start with one goal, so in a sense, the first repeat is global. Since [repeat esplit] generates one subgoal, [repeat repeat esplit] will apply [repeat esplit] to this subgoal, and it succeeds. The issue at hand is that tactics are sensitive to the order in which the goals are considered, which there is no real way around: unification of evars is a side-effect.\n\nMaybe it will help to consider the following script (in trunk) were additional [repeat] don't make a difference:\n\nGoal exists x : Prop, x /\\ x = True.\nProof.\n  esplit.\n  esplit.\n  all:repeat repeat esplit.\nFail Qed.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337520732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337520733","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3409#issuecomment-337520733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3409","id":337520733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMDczMw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-21T11:37:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:21:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nSo I think we can close this bug...\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337520733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
