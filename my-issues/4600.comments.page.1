I might even be able to extend my bug-minimizer script to minimize CoqIDE bugs, then.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540600","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4600#issuecomment-337540600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4600","id":337540600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MDYwMA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T21:47:27Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:19:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\n*** Bug [BZ#4601](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%234601%22) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337540600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
