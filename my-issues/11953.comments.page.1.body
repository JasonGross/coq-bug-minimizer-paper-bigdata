@JasonGross adding some code to the toplevel init path to set the proper `Topfmt` parameters should do the trick. We could use autodetection, read some env variable, etc...
I think my preferred method would be from reading env variables.  I don't see a reliable way to do autodetection...
With the `-set` command line option, I suspect that you may basically have what you expect with `-set "Printing Width=10000"`.
