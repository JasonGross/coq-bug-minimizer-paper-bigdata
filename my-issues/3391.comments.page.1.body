Sometimes I get error messages such as

Unable to satisfy the following constraints:
In environment:
H : Funext
A : PreCategory

?29 : "Funext"

It would be nice if Coq mentioned something like "Some branches terminated with universe inconsistencies", or if it defaulted it [Set Printing Universes] when the cause might have been a universe inconsistency.
