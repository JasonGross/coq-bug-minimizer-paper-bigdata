So ending a section causes a massive substitution and type-checking process.\n\nI agree that Coq could detect that the section did not contain any variable and thus did not need any reverting, but I sincerely doubt anyone will ever focus on improving this use case. So I am closing this report.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
