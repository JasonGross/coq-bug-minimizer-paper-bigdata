For example, [unify a b modulo beta iota zeta delta] should be the same as [unify a b], and [unify a b modulo none] should be the same as [constr_eq a b] if [a] and [b] have no evars.\n\nI find myself writing [syntax_unify] in Ltac, the behavior of which I want to be [unify a b modulo beta iota zeta] (i.e., it should unify evars, and beta/iota/zeta reduce, but it shouldn't unfold any constants).\n\nThis is useful for writing tactics, when full-blown unification is too expensive and too slow to fail because it unfolds too many things.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337522354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
