Fixpoint foo {a b x : nat} {struct x} : True. (* Error: Cannot set implicit 
argument number 2: it has no name. *)

Note that removing [a] or [b], or making it structural on [a] or [b], removes 
the error.

Fixed in trunk, I believe by Hugo (haven't bothered to find the commit that 
fixes let-ins in a bunch of places).
