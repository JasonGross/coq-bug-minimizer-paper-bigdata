Cast nodes have a clear tendency to disappear during reduction, so it's hard to understand what is going on when sending a strategy-annotated term to the kernel.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/622020265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/622040561","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12200#issuecomment-622040561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12200","id":622040561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjA0MDU2MQ==","user":{"login":"SkySkimmer","id":2461932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2461932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/SkySkimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkySkimmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T18:58:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T18:58:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"coqchk doesn't use VM or native even if there's a vmcast/nativecast afaik","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/622040561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/622615790","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12200#issuecomment-622615790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12200","id":622615790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjYxNTc5MA==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-02T00:00:28Z","updated_at":"2020-05-02T00:00:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@SkySkimmer you're right, I don't know what I was thinking about when I wrote this.
