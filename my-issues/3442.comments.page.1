Since these [abstract]s are now let-expanded in opaque proofs, it would be nice if they were a true no-op, timing wise, in such opaque proofs.  Additionally/alternatively, it would be nice to have noisy warnings about evilness or inefficiency or whatever whenever [abstract] is used inside a [Qed]'d proof.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521190","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3442#issuecomment-337521190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3442","id":337521190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMTE5MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-19T09:53:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:23:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @gares\n\nWell done removing abstract.\n\nCould you please explain what you mean by \"let-expanded\" ?\nDo you mean inlined?\n\nJust for the records, during proof construction abstract still behaves\nas before, it is at Qed time that things are inlined.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337521192","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3442#issuecomment-337521192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3442","id":337521192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyMTE5Mg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-19T13:17:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:23:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nSorry, yes, I mean inlined.
