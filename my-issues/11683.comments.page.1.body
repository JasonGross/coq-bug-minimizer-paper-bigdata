The expression is highlighted in CoqIDE though.
Maybe "following" is confusing? Why not "This expression"?
In CoqIDE, yes.  On the command line, no.  In coqtop, the expression fines before.  And in PG, the cursor is moved to the beginning of the expression, but it is not highlighted.
FTR after #14027 we also get the type of the expression. I am a bit reluctant to print the whole expression since it won't be very informative in general. I'd recommend closing this bug since #14027 makes it easier to understand what is going on. The fact we have deficient UIs should not be circumvented by making the base program overly verbose.

Sounds like the real issue is https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG/issues/548 then.
IÂ second Maxime's recommendation of changing "the following" by "this" before closing this issue.
@Zimmi48 your desires are orders: #14133.
