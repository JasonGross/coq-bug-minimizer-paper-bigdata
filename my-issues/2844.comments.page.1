I'm not sure whether the fact that [f.(bar) a] works is a feature, or a bug:\nI've used code like this for \"fake\" record fields, so that I can define a sort-polymorphic record one way and then pretend that all it's fields have a more convenient type (convertible with the type of the original field).
