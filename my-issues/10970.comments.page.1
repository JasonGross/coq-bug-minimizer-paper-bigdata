Here's a snippet from an Ltac profile I was analyzing this week, where the tactic passed to `assert_succeeds` did take some time, and I could imagine situations where it costs even more.\r\n\r\n```\r\n │└assert_succeeds ---------------------   0.0%   5.3%    1756    0.092s\r\n │└assert_fails ------------------------   0.0%   5.3%    1756    0.092s\r\n │└tac ---------------------------------   0.1%   5.2%    1756    0.091s\r\n │ ├─clear - (ne_var_list) -------------   3.1%   3.1%    1756    0.073s\r\n │ └─case dummy ------------------------   2.0%   2.0%    1756    0.064s\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think re-implementing it in OCaml in a way which preserves the error message would be useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/546654452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
