The reason is that a goal printing is done in a temporary local `type_scope` which takes precedence over the abbreviation. The following however works:\r\n```coq\r\nNotation hide := (_ = _).\r\nCheck 1 = 1.\r\n(* hide : Prop *)\r\n```\r\nSo, I don't know what to think about it. Should `type_scope` be skipped in the printing algorithm? That would make an exception hard to justified. Or are the real examples different enough from the example above so that the new behavior does not matter in practice?\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to go back to the idea of assigning scopes to abbreviations, but for printing only (since having resolution of qualified names dependent on scopes look to me to be a rather heavy change which would have to be justified by more extensive examples). Having abbreviation scopes for printing only would be rather cheap to implement.\r\n\r\n@gares (or maybe @ggonthier): Would it be useful for mathcomp that abbreviations could come with a scope for printing only?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/372030597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
