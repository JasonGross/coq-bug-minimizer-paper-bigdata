Here is one I came across recently: https://github.com/LexiFi/landmarks. We would need to modify each of the dune files in the repo, similar to what @ejgallego did for code coverage. It should then give us some useful data about various code paths. We could probably combine it with the bench somehow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1030946403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1030986796","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/15636#issuecomment-1030986796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/15636","id":1030986796,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh849c5ws","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T01:36:18Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T01:36:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I agree that enabling Ltac profiling would be interesting but it would change the semantics of tactics in weird ways so that we may end up measuring unrelated performances.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by this?
