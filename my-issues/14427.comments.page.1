You can remove the warning passing the corresponding `-w` option, this is what coq_makefile does.\r\n\r\nIn 8.15 `coqc` will probably stop producing native files at all, but we're not there yet.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/851838521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
