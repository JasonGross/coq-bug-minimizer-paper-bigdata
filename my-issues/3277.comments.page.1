We should provide you with better Ltac primitives one day (or just throw Ltac away anyway).\n\nIn the precise example you give, I think it comes from the way tactics in terms are evaluated. The precise moment of their computation is not specified, and you shall not rely on the equally non specified unification, which may explain your error here. I'll have a look at it to be sure.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337518577","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3277#issuecomment-337518577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3277","id":337518577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxODU3Nw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-20T20:26:14Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:15:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nOK, I localized the problem.
