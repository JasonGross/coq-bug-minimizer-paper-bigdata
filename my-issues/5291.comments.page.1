This is one \r\nof two things I need to make the categories [1 → Cᵒᵖ] and [(1 → C)ᵒᵖ] \r\njudgmentally equal.  In particular, I'd like the following to work:\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet Primitive Projections.\r\nRecord unit : Set := tt {}.\r\nCheck fun x : unit => (eq_refl : tt = x).\r\nCheck fun x : unit => (eq_refl : x = tt).\r\nCheck fun x y : unit => (eq_refl : x = y).\r\nCheck eq_refl : (fun x : unit => x) = (fun x : unit => tt).\r\nCheck fun C (homC : C -> C -> Type) (F : unit -> C)\r\n      => (eq_refl : (forall x y, unit -> homC (F x) (F y)) = (forall x y, unit \r\n-> homC (F y) (F x))).\r\n(* flipping the order of the arguments to homC should not matter because [x] \r\nand [y] should be judgmentally

way to do it.  For example, wouldn't it suffice to calculate the head term of the hnf of the types?  I expect this calculation to be fast in almost all cases, though I suppose it might get slow at application nodes if you need to renumber DeBruijn indices or do capture-avoiding substitution...\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550391","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5291#issuecomment-337550391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5291","id":337550391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MDM5MQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T00:54:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:51:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment
