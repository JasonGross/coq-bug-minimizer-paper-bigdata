If you do this, then you can, perhaps, present the user with the illusion that primitive projections are not special.\n-- \nIt sounds very hackish, and from an implementation perspective, App takes two terms and return a new term, there's no way to recognize a non-primitive projection there as the environment is not passed around. Similarly for λ ... x.(fst), that would require looking into the \"function term\", and this solution would not be stable by beta-reduction, i.e if you have λ ... b being beta-convertible to λ .... x.(fst). This opens another can of worms.\n--\nSeparately: When I was talking to Adam about this, he suggested having primitive projections unfold to the old (match-based) version, and having some iterators (e.g., the ones to do ltac pattern matching) use the unfolded versions, and have other iterators (the kernel term comparison ones) use the folded, argumentless/primitive versions.  I seem to recall you mentioning that this would end up being too slow and lose all the benefits of having primitive projections in the first place.  Can you remind me why this is?\n\nThere's no way to infer the arguments without retyping the projection application, and that would be necessary to \"unfold to a match-based version\". This would make Ltac pattern-matching, and other places where you expand always slow. I have a development using primitive projections where I never need to use the expanded forms/parameters, i.e. their primitive status do fit perfectly, even inside Ltac patterns. The compatibility mode is just that, for compatibility with existing developments, it shouldn't get in the way of new use cases benefiting from the extension.\nAlso it's not so clear when you should look at one or the other presentation, e.g. during unification, which one would you consider? There's also calls to syntactic comparison in unification/pattern-matching and you'd need to be careful to be consistent, if that is at all possible.\n\nI really prefer the current mode, where r.(p) is the primitive version, the kernel is uncluttered, and we just have a (soon to be optional) parsing/printing compatibility layer _outside_ to make p r parse as r.(p) and print as p r, and a few special cases in matching for making the eta-expanded versions match syntactically with the primitive ones.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337523735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
