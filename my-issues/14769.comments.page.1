From the main `opam-repository` I suppose? The CoqIDE package depends on `conf-adwaita-icon-theme` which, according to https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/conf-adwaita-icon-theme/conf-adwaita-icon-theme.1/opam, should ensure that `adwaita-icon-theme` is installed on Ubuntu. Do you mean that this package should be fixed to install `adwaita-icon-theme-full` instead? In any case, that's probably an issue to report to the opam-repository maintainers at https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/896818981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/896963037","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14769#issuecomment-896963037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14769","id":896963037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh841dpHd","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-11T16:16:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T16:16:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CoqIDE, at least, requires `adwaita-icon-theme-full`.
