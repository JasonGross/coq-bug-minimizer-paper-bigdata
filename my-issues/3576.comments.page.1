I haven't tried to figure out if it only shows up the first time I run CoqIDE on a given machine, the first time I run a CoqIDE after compiling it, the first time I run a CoqIDE after booting my computer, or something else.  (This behavior, that compile, first run has the error, subsequent ones don't, was also observed by a friend of mine who just compiled the same version of Coq trunk.)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337523454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
