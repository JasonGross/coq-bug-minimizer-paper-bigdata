for late answer, I did not realize it was about `match`.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the algorithm for pattern-matching compilation is potentially \"exponential\" in that it may try two different forms of return clauses. If you give the return clause explicitly, it will write \"fail\" only once:\r\n```coq\r\nDefinition a x := match x return Prop with\r\n                          | O => ltac:(idtac \"fail\";\r\n                                       let f := constr:(I : I) in\r\n                                       exact True)\r\n                          | S _ => True\r\n                          end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere were some attemps to unify the two attempts into one but the unification was not strong enough to handle the both forms into one.\r\n\r\nThere is another source of backtrack which is the one you highlighted (in `compile_alias`) but it is not in play in your example. Here is an example where it shows up:\r\n```coq\r\nDefinition a x := match x  with\r\n                          | S (S y as z) => ltac:(idtac \"fail\";\r\n                                       let f := constr:(I : I) in\r\n                                       exact True)\r\n                          | _ => True\r\n                          end.\r\n(* \"fail\" printed four times *)\r\n```\r\nFor this second source of backtrack, it would be good to do something too.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/347041995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/347043711","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/6252#issuecomment-347043711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/6252","id":347043711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzA0MzcxMQ==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-26T22:26:13Z","updated_at":"2017-11-26T22:26:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@herbelin Thanks!
