Set Universe Polymorphism.
Section foo.
  Context (v : Type).
  Axiom a : True <-> False.
  Hint Resolve -> a. (* Error:
Cannot mix universe polymorphic and monomorphic declarations in sections.
 *)


This is because Hint Resolve with arrow declares the projection constant in Extratactics.project_hint which doesn't respect Universe Polymorphism (both option and `Polymorphic Hint ...`) so the constant is always monomorphic.
PR incoming.
