See `check_for_coloneq` in `g_tactic.mlg` for a complex example.\r\nFor this one, you'd probably want to keep a running nesting count of square brackets and then check for the final `:`.  (Though I expect that could be broken by a notation that's with an unbalanced number of square brackets.\r\n\r\nIf there are other common cases that don't play well as patterns here, perhaps they should all be considered at the same time rather than one by one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/640956899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/641156273","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12472#issuecomment-641156273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12472","id":641156273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTE1NjI3Mw==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T09:26:30Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T09:26:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixing this instance will still leave the grammar fragile, since we have arbitrary notations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/641156273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/641159427","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12472#issuecomment-641159427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12472","id":641159427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTE1OTQyNw==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T09:29:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T09:29:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"What is more confusing to me is why we have to wrap the body of the hypothesis inside square brackets in the Ltac matching syntax...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/641159427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
