Happy debugging...\n\nI fully agree with Jason, if I write (fun x => f x), the x I write after fun surely binds the x I pass to f and no other x.  If the Ltac machinery needs to\ncompile it to \"fresh x in ...\", then it should do it for me.\n\nIf I'm right it is a regression, then it is a major problem IMO.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337534509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337534511","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4221#issuecomment-337534511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4221","id":337534511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUzNDUxMQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T13:09:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:01:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nYes, it is a regression.
