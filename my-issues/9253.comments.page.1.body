`META.coq.in` will be removed / orphaned as soon as the Dune build is considered out of experimental status which should happen pretty soon.
This file can be removed as soon as Dune becomes the only supported build system (likely before 8.10). In the meantime, indeed, this file should reflect closely what is generated by Dune but it seems a bit overkill to add a CI test just for this for such a short period.
