The main use-case that I see, these days, for the `-compat` options, is allowing users to be compatible with both master and the latest released version, even when there are no easy backwards compatible fixes (because, e.g., files have been renamed).  The last time this happened was in the 8.6 -> 8.6.1/8.7 transition, where you are required to `Require Import Coq.extraction.Extraction.` to use extraction in 8.7, and it is an error to `Require Import Coq.extraction.Extraction.` in 8.6.0.  The solution is to pass `-compat 8.6` to projects needing to compile with Coq 8.6 and master and use extraction.  This solution only works on the CI if `-compat 8.6` actually loads `Coq.Compat.Coq86` even before v8.7 is branched.  (It is possible that this would be a better way to do compatibility in software foundations than using `sed` to insert lines at the beginning of a couple of files: if we build software foundations with the additional flag `-compat 8.6`, I believe we'll no longer need to edit the files with `sed` (and the numeral notations PR would not need to add yet more `sed` lines to the build).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/415829755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/415976318","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8311#issuecomment-415976318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/8311","id":415976318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTk3NjMxOA==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T15:18:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T15:18:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the summary.
