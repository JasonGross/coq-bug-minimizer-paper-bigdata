put it the other way, perhaps package systems would do a better job here if the need for rebuilding coq every time ocaml is rebuilt was documented :). Not everyone has given up on being able to upgrade a highly-depended-on package without replacing everything downstream. I don't think that decision by itself qualifies as broken, it's just a different trade-off between cost of updates on the user and default levels of engineering sanity (and often effort) expected from the software being packaged. And it seems entirely plausible to me that Coq package maintainers, while overall qualified for the task, have just never happened to run into this issue. Yes, one could guess that plugins are ocaml under the hood and thus likely need coq to match to compiler version, but the point of documentation is to let people get things right without guessing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/623033133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/623151772","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12232#issuecomment-623151772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12232","id":623151772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzE1MTc3Mg==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-03T17:49:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-03T17:49:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The specific error message should not be documented since it is not a Coq error message but rather an OCaml one.
