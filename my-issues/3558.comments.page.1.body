This code should work:

Set Primitive Projections.
Record idR T := { x : T }.
Definition foo T (y : idR T) :=
  match y with
    | Build_idR _ x' => 0
  end. (* Toplevel input, characters 0-79:
Error: Pattern-matching expression on an object of inductive type idR
has invalid information. *)

This seems to have been fixed, I cannot reproduce it.
