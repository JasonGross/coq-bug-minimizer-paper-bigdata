We shouldn't even have this warning in the first place. In an ideal world we should be able to refer to absolute names, and the warning would become moot.
So is it reasonable to disable this warning today? I've also run into it in module experiments...

So something does go wrong today? If this `user messages` issue is blocked on some actual bug, making the dependency explicit would be the first step of solving it, and even just understanding workarounds.
