It is not meant to prevent a logical inconsistency. The .vo representation did not change between 8.5 and 8.5pl1, as far as I know.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541853","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4692#issuecomment-337541853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4692","id":337541853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T18:57:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:23:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nI agree with Guillaume , so definitely a WONTFIX. Plus this bug clearly qualifies as \"loading a vo can make dragons fly out of your nose\", as you can already make Coq accept handcrafted proofs of False (as e.g. demonstrated by Guillaume again).
