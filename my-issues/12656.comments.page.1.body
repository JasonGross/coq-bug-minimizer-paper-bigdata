Well, there's more to it than that.  If coq_makefile is being run on a coq installation that was installed from precompiled binaries, then $(OCAMLFIND) itself is likely to be a nonexistent file-path...
Nah, I think that's fine.  If `$(OCAMLFIND)` is empty or non-existant, then using it to fetch the version number returns the empty string (possibly with an error message on stderr, which should be sent to /dev/null).  Errors in subshells aren't fatal for the parent shell, so we'll still get the error message, and something saying "Coq was compiled with OCaml version 'foo', your system has OCaml version ''" seems informative enough.  (Of course, we can choose to give a different error message when the version is empty.)
