It would be nice to be able to separately specify: setoid relations or only 
Leibniz, modulo delta or not, (possibly) modulo beta/iota/zeta or not, under 
binders with pointwise relations or not.  Presumably this requires some sort of 
generic way of specifying optional flags for tactics...

Yes, I agree completely.
