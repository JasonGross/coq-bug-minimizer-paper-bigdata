Your guess is [right](https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/4abf92639c13002c2ca8aff0015a42aff5c6b329/interp/notation_ops.ml#L39).

What to do is a bit unclear (comparing tactic code would be a bit difficult with locations, arbitrary generic arguments, ...). Maybe assuming that two tactics always differ by default, even if exactly the same)?
Fixed by #12950 but the current semantics adopted in #12950 makes that redefining a notation in only-parsing mode cancels the whole of a previous combined parsing-printing notation, including its printing part.

In particular, this means displaying `Literal 1` in the third and fifth example.
