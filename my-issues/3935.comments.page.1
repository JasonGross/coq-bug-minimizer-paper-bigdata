I agree it is a confusing annotation.  However, it allows the test-suite file to be edited in PG (without -emacs, PG will loop waiting for output it recognizes), and also have the test-suite makefile pass -quick (the makefile strips -emacs from the list automatically).\n\n2. See 1, I think?\n\n3. That is bug [BZ#3934](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%233934%22).
