But as I said, you cannot expect them to guess that the file that is shipped in the tarball is different from the one in the repository.\r\n\r\nHere is a bit more context. For various reasons (security, accountability, auditing, and so on), Debian maintains a git mirror of all the packages. Except for the `debian/` subdirectory in the packages, this is a pristine copy of the upstream repository. They have no problem working with projects that have no upstream repository; they just create one from scratch then. But, when there exists one, they have a priori no reason not to use it, unless they are told that it is not authoritative. \r\n\r\nAnyway, once they try to ship Coq 8.13, they will notice the issue. And at that point they will either patch Lablgtk or Coq to fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/701323722/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/701468486","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/13079#issuecomment-701468486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/13079","id":701468486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTQ2ODQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T15:33:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T15:33:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
