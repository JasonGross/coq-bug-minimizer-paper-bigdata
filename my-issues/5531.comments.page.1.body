I would like this to work:

Goal true = false -> False.
  intro H.
  lazymatch goal with
  | [ H : ?x = ?y |- False ]
    => refine match H in (_ = y') return match y' with
                                         | y => False
                                         | _ => True (* Error: This clause is 
redundant. *)
                                         end with
              | eq_refl => _
              end
  end.
