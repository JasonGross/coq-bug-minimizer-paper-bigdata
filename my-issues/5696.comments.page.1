Currently, if I understand correctly the code, \nthe \"exact z\" is turned into a \"let z:=constr:(1) with e:=constr:(a) in exact z\".\n\nMaybe it could be turned into a \"uconstr\" instead, but manually trying \"let z:=uconstr:(1) with e:=uconstr:(a) in exact z\" also fails, so I don't know if it would help.\n\nI looked by curiosity but Pierre-Marie is the real expert here.\n\nBy the way, what is your use case for ltac in notations? For instance, I saw in BZ#3881 that you had a:\n\nNotation \"g 'o' f\" := ltac:(let g' := g in let f' := f in exact (fun x => g' (f' x))) (at level 40, left associativity). (* Ensure that x is not captured in [g] or [f] in case they contain holes *)\n\nIf this is a workaround for a weakness of the Notation mechanism, maybe would it be as good to fix the interpretation of notations? Do you have a concrete case where\n\nNotation \"g 'o' f\" := (fun x => g (f x)) (at level 40, left associativity).\n\ndoes not work but the former works?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337556375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337556376","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5696#issuecomment-337556376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5696","id":337556376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1NjM3Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T19:50:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T11:10:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\n> but manually trying \"let z:=uconstr:(1) with e:=uconstr:(a) in exact z\" also fails\n\nOh, ew.
