me correct myself even more:  I am not sure about my claim that \"a huge natural number is created\"; I recall seeing that behavior in dealing with floats recently, but not necessarily in this

So maybe it's possible that a different reduction order could avoid a blow-up.  But I don't think that matters.   The Flocq system already has a `Binary.erase` function which does the same thing that my `rebuild_float` does, and presumably for exactly the same purpose:  to discard large proofs and replace them with small proofs.    Presumably this problem of \"large proofs in binary floats\" has existed even before there was Number.number notation.  \r\n\r\nThis systematic method (replace large proofs with small ones) could probably be applied to other applications of Number notation, not only Flocq floating point.  Therefore, there is a (relatively) simple workaround for the user.  And on the other hand, replacing `cbv` by `lazy` won't _reliably_ solve the problem for users.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even though my diagnosis of the problem may not have been 100% accurate, I still recommend to close this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/908319217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/908540619","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/14807#issuecomment-908540619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/14807","id":908540619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh842JzrL","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T17:31:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T17:31:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I will defer to @ppedrot on closing this issue.
