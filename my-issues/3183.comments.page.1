This is all well and good, because I can see that [1 + 1] and [2] unify easily.  But if [f] takes ten or twenty arguments, and most of them unify, but not obviously, it's a pain to figure out which don't unify.  At the very least, tell me which argument of [f] is wrong.  Even better, give me a trace of the path I need to take to get to the things that don't unify (\"impossible to unify \"f 2 3\" with \"f (1 + 1) 2\" because second arguments \"3\" and \"2\" do not unify because \"S O\" does not unify with \"O\"\" or something)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337516869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
