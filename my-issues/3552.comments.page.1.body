I'd like a [fail_with_context] variant of [fail], which gives the
"""
Error:
In environment
<context>
Tactic failure: <error message>
"""

message rather than just

"""
Error: Tactic failure: <error message>
"""

This is useful for giving nice error messages in tactics that are meant to fail gracefully.
