The call to coqchk in Iris (https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/iris-coq/) looks like this:\n\n\"/home/r/bin/coq-8.5/bin/coqchk\" -silent -o -Q \".\" iris option fin_map_dom bset fin_maps vector pmap stringmap fin_collections mapset proof_irrel hashset pretty countable orders natmap strings relations collections listset streams gmap base tactics prelude listset_nodup finite numbers nmap zmap coPset lexico set decidable list error functions hlist sorting cmra cmra_big_op cmra_tactics sts auth gmap cofe base dra cofe_solver agree dec_agree excl iprod upred upred_tactics upred_big_op upred_hlist frac csum list updates local_updates gset coPset model adequacy lifting invariants ownership weakestpre pviewshifts hoare viewshifts language ectx_language ectxi_language ectx_lifting ghost_ownership saved_prop auth sts namespaces boxes counter_examples iris lang tactics wp_tactics lifting derived notation heap spawn par assert lock ticket_lock counter barrier specification protocol proof proofmode adequacy heap_lang one_shot joining_existentials proofmode barrier_client list_reverse tree_sum counter coq_tactics pviewshifts environments intro_patterns spec_patterns tactics notation invariants weakestpre ghost_ownership classes class_instances\n\nNotice, for example, that \"sts\" appears in the list twice. This is because we have \"iris.algebra.sts\" and \"iris.program_logic.sts\". If coqchk equates -R and -Q, it cannot even tell the two apart, so how should it be doing the checking properly? While testing coqchk (replacing -Q with -R in the call above), I frequently ran into the issue that it would pick up files like \"proofmode/sts.vo\" which are leftovers from the time when there used to be a \"proofmode/sts.v\". Plain Coq doesn't care that these old .vo files are still around since they are not imported, but coqchk picks up the wrong file and then complains about the .vo file not matching what the rest of the development looks like now:\n\n  User error: Cannot find library iris.program_logic.global_functor in loadpath\n\n(The error is btw. not very helpful to find the culprit, as it does not say what is importing global_functor.) Of course I should still delete those files, but this goes to show that coqchk taking the -Q for a -R *is* a problem.\n\nIris doesn't yet compile with Coq 8.6 (see bug [BZ#5001](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%235001%22)), so I cannot yet test whether this got any better in the newer version. At the very least, the Makefile generator would have to emit full paths and not just basenames for coqchk, and looking at the Coq 8.6 Makefile for iris, that doesn't seem to be the case -- so I suppose things are still equally broken, but can't confirm. Should I still report a bug for this?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541882","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4693#issuecomment-337541882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4693","id":337541882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T13:35:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @silene\n\nYes, the fact that coq_makefile does not use fully-qualified logical paths when invoking coqchk is a bug.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541883","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/4693#issuecomment-337541883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/4693","id":337541883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU0MTg4Mw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T13:56:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @RalfJung\n\nReported as bug [BZ#5020](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%235020%22)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337541883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
