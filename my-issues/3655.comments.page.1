At the current time, I capitulated in having a check which is fully correct. For instance on goals such as \"?m = ?n\", if one applies a lemma such as eq_sym, i.e. if one tries to find ?x and ?y such that the type \"?y = ?x\" of \"eq_sym ?x ?y _\" unifies with \"?m = ?n\", one might by bad luck get the result ?m:=?y and ?n:=?x, leaving ?x and ?y apparently unresolved, which is not the case.\n\nComing back to \"pose\" and to my concern for regularity of the design, what I'm saying is just that having\n\n<< pose _. >> fails\n<< Tactic Notation \"foo\" open_constr(x) := pose x. pose _. >> succeeds\nor you last example succeeding too\n\nis inconsistent, and this is why I reopened the bug.\n\nFacing this inconsistency, I see two possibilities:\n1. providing \"pose\" and \"epose\" (and \"set\" and \"eset\") following the established distinction between e- and non e-variants of tactics, and having all examples failing if not using \"epose\".\n2. having \"pose _\" not failing.\n\nBoth are ok to me. More precisely, if we want to maintain the e- vs non e- model, I think solution 1 is the most consistent design choice (but maybe also the most tricky to implement). But I'm ok with doing an exception for pose and set. Conversely, if we adopt 2, then maybe this is a sign that we should think about progressively renouncing to the e- vs non e- model.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524769","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3655#issuecomment-337524769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3655","id":337524769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUyNDc2OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T13:30:58Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:33:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ejgallego\n\nWhat is the status of this, has the situation improved with the e-tactics PR?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337524769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
