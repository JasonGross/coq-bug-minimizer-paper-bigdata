This code works in 8.4, fails in 8.6, because [intuition] specializes a section 
variable and then [auto] refuses to apply a lemma that depends on it.

Axiom admit : forall {T}, T.
Section foo.
  Context (A B C : Prop) (H : A -> B).
  Lemma H' : A -> C.
  Proof. intro a; generalize (H a); apply admit. Qed.

  Hint Immediate H'.

  Goal A -> C /\ C.
    intros.
    intuition.
  Qed.
End foo.
