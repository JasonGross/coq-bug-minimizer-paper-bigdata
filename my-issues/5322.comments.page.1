This is indeed related to ade2363 as reported in [BZ#5322](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%235322%22). The work done in this commit had started to reveal a bug in the presence of let-ins but it had failed to correctly fix the let-in problem, leading instead to the new problems you observed. All of the original problem with let-ins and [BZ#5322](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%235322%22), [BZ#5324](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%22Original%20bug%20ID%3A%20BZ%235324%22) are fixed.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
