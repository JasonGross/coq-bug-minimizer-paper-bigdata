Results turn out that a large portion of these features do have a medium to large correlation with GFI. \r\nWe then build a machine learning model based on these features to predict GFI. The experiments on a dataset of 12k issues from Github show that 0.90 AUC can be achieved. \r\n\r\nOur tool shows that this issue has a very large possibility to be a GFI. \r\nCould you please tell us whether it should be labeled as a GFI?\r\nAnd if you have any comments or suggestions with this tool, could you please tell us? \r\nThank you so much.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/731887200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/731888090","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/13280#issuecomment-731888090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/13280","id":731888090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTg4ODA5MA==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-23T01:40:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-23T01:40:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@G-Sheridan yes, that seems reasonable, thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/731888090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
