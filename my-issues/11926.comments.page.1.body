@ppedrot Just told me about `Print Debug GC`.  Hooking the Ltac Profiler into this sort of information (whichever statistic is the most useful, or even all of the statistics) would be quite useful
Interesting detail here about what's being measured.  To get the net increase in the heap size from a tactic, you probably have to force garbage collections before and after each tactic.  It may be easier to get an idea how much memory a tactic allocates (including discarded items), though that would be thrown off by garbage collections in the middle of a tactic.
