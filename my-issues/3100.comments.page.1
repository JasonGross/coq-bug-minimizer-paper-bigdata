Don't know if this is what \"we\" want but at least, this is the explanation. Whether the rhs should be typable from only the lhs and not from the instances of the rhs found in the goal is an open question to me.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515446","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3100#issuecomment-337515446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3100","id":337515446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxNTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-16T09:06:20Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:06:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @herbelin\n\nIn any case, I consider this bug closed.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
