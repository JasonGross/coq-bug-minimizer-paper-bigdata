The following are sane behaviors, all (or most) of which should be \naccessible, and have a uniform way of specifying them:\n\n- this change is specific to this section/module, and should not escape it \n([Local])\n- this change should be associated with the current module; when the module is \nimported, the change should be applied.  If the module is re-imported, the \nchange should be moved above any changes since then (so notations and hints \nshould get priority).\n- this flag is associated with this particular identifier; the module should \nnot need to be imported to get this change.  (It might make sense to forbid \nthis modifier unless the identifier you're attaching it to is defined in the \ncurrent module)\n- this flag is project-global; it should follow [Require] and not be associated \nwith any particular module.  Re-importing the module should not alter anything.\n\nIn particular, things like [simpl never] and implicit argument modifiers \nsometimes are part of defining a constant, and sometimes are flags to control \nautomation or display in a specific script.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337548062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1009308474","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5131#issuecomment-1009308474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5131","id":1009308474,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh848KNM6","user":{"login":"Alizter","id":8614547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MTQ1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8614547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter","html_url":"https://github.com/Alizter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alizter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-10T20:19:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T20:19:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @ppedrot How much of this has been resolved?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1009308474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
