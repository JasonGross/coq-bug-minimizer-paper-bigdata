It shows pretty well the unlucky case of the conversion test when the optimization for fast reduction (sharing) plays against term comparison by inflating duplicated terms that will never reduce to something smaller.\n\nMy attempt to keep track of equivalence classes of terms was helping but the bookkeeping was very costly for the cases where things do not explode.  I did put this line of research on hold, waiting for more free time an maybe some extra ideas and/or help.  BTW, this is the very same problem that is worked around in MathComp with the \"black art of locking and projection in-lining\":\na way to \"drive\" the term comparison algorithm without patching Coq.\n\nIt would be nice to have these files ported to the current version of Coq.\n\nw.r.t. the patch, I think it would make sense to have a \"Set ConversionNoSharing\" flag to be used in specific files.  With this flag always on not even the standard library passes.  This would make it possible to compile things without patching Coq (assuming the form of universe polymorphism that just landed makes the other half of the patch non necessary).\n\nCiao\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337519180","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3309#issuecomment-337519180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/3309","id":337519180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzUxOTE4MA==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-10T18:41:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T09:17:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ppedrot\n\nIs it sound to desactivate this flag?
