Also replacing `(pv:=_)` with `(pv:parameters:=_)` makes it go through.
Here's a smaller example of this one:
```coq
Class Foo := foo : True.
Instance: Foo := I.
Definition bar (v:=_) (H : @foo v = @foo v) : True := I.
```
My guess is that the issue here is that the "available for typeclass resolution" flag is not being inherited appropriately when evars are unified
Seems to be fixed in 8.14. Will add to test-suite.
