The problem is that the old unification checks that a term is closed before deciding what to do (in `Unification.matchrec`), and rewrite relies on unification to apply the lemma. I had a patch somewhere that probably solved this problem which was even turned into a PR, but closed because no observable effect.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this is #14253.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/862119598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/862121527","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12600#issuecomment-862121527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12600","id":862121527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjEyMTUyNw==","user":{"login":"ppedrot","id":1202327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot","html_url":"https://github.com/ppedrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppedrot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-16T07:26:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T07:26:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I confirm that #14253 solves the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/862121527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1028122552","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/12600#issuecomment-1028122552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/12600","id":1028122552,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABUDh849R-e4","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-02T16:31:18Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T16:31:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ppedrot #14253 only fixed this when the rewriting lemma has no evars, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/1028122552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
