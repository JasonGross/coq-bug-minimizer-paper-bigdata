It was useful to know which constants were defined, even if in some cases there were a bit too many of them.\r\n\r\nFor instance with `Function`:\r\n```\r\nRequire Import Recdef.\r\n\r\nFunction div2 n { wf lt n } :=\r\n  match n with\r\n  | 0 | 1 => 0\r\n  | S (S n) => S (div2 n)\r\n  end.\r\nProof.\r\n  - intros. apply le_S, le_n.\r\n  - apply Wf_nat.lt_wf.\r\nQed.\r\n```\r\nWith Coq 8.9:\r\n```\r\ndiv2_tcc is defined\r\ndiv2_terminate is defined\r\ndiv2_ind is defined\r\ndiv2_rec is defined\r\ndiv2_rect is defined\r\nR_div2_correct is defined\r\nR_div2_complete is defined\r\n```\r\nWith Coq 8.12, there is no output at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/991798338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
