Here is code that works in 8.4, but fails in 8.5beta2 with a unification error:

Goal (forall a b : nat, Set = (a = b)) -> Set.
Proof.
  clear.
  intro H.
  erewrite (fun H' => H _ H'). (* Toplevel input, characters 22-23:
Error: In environment
H : forall a b : nat, Set = (a = b)
Unable to unify "?n@ {H':=?M2134}" with "?n@ {H':=?H'}". *)
