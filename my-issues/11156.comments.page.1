How do they work? Is it documented how to add one?\r\n\r\nThe complexity tests in the test suite are based on the idea that if the complexity is different, for a large enough entry, the time difference factor is at least, say, 20, i.e., e.g. 0.5s and 10s, so that even with an approximation of the speed of the processor, we are able to discriminate the two values enough.\r\n\r\nTo add a test, if I remember correctly, a line of the form `(* Expected time < 2s *)` needs to occur in the file. The reference time is supposed to correspond to a 6120 bogomips and a cross-multiplication is done to adjust to the approximative bogomips of the machine running the test. I don't know `rdtsc`. If it gives a better approximation, that may be a good idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/557240582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/557465826","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11156#issuecomment-557465826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/11156","id":557465826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzQ2NTgyNg==","user":{"login":"Zimmi48","id":1108325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48","html_url":"https://github.com/Zimmi48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zimmi48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T09:48:24Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T09:48:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unfortunately the complexity tests are indeed not documented as of today in the test-suite README, even though they seem very useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/557465826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/557997119","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11156#issuecomment-557997119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/11156","id":557997119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzk5NzExOQ==","user":{"login":"JasonGross","id":396076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/396076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonGross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonGross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T05:33:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T05:33:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@herbelin I suspect `rdtsc` will give a similarly good approximation, though it should be available even on platforms without bogomips, I think.
