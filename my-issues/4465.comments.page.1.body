Ltac goal := match goal with |- ?G => G end.
Ltac idtac_goal_n n := let G := goal in idtac n G.
Goal (exists n m : nat, m = 1).
Proof.
  repeat unshelve refine (ex_intro _ _ _).
  par:((idtac_goal_n 0; exact 0) + (idtac_goal_n 1; exact 1) + (idtac_goal_n 2; exact eq_refl)).
Defined. (* Error: The term "eq_refl" has type "1 = 1" while it is expected to have type "0 = 1". *)

The error should be caught by [par]
