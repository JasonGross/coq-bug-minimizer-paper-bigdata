One way to make the error message more informative for the ordinary user, but not less informative for the developers, as you desire, would be retain all the information currently displayed, but to add an indication that this is an internal error (coq bug) that should be reported, rather than something provoked by incorrect behavior on the part of the user, as you have informed us.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337515080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
