Without this target, we cannot test HoTT on Travis, because building \nall of Coq takes too long.  Please bring back this target.  The requirement is \nthat \"coqlight\" must build, at least, the subset of the stdlib that coqtop \nloads by default on boot, and install-coqlight must install enough files (.vo \nand plugins) that coqtop will run without crashing.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550147","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5272#issuecomment-337550147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5272","id":337550147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MDE0Nw==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T22:58:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:50:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @ejgallego\n\nHi Jason, would `make states` work in this case?\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/comments/337550149","html_url":"https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/5272#issuecomment-337550149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coq/coq/issues/5272","id":337550149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzU1MDE0OQ==","user":{"login":"coqbot","id":13040781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot","html_url":"https://github.com/coqbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coqbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T23:03:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T10:50:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comment author: @JasonGross\n\nNo, I would need something like `make install-states` which also installs plugins.
