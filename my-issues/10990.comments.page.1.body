There's a similar issue with
```
Warning: Collision between bound variable x and a metavariable of same name.
[meta-collision,ltac]
```
from
```coq
Set Warnings Append "+meta-collision".
Goal forall x : nat, (fun y => y) = (fun y : nat => y).
  match goal with
  | [ |- forall x, (fun y => @?f y) = ?y ] => idtac
  end.
```
