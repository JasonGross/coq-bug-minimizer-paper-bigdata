Here is code that I would like to work:

Require Import Setoid.
Definition dummy : forall x y : nat, x = y -> x = y := fun _ _ x => x.
Goal forall x y : nat, x = y -> x = y.
  intros.
  erewrite dummy at 1 by eassumption.
  Undo.
  erewrite dummy by eassumption. (* no applicable tactic *)

This should possibly be behind a compatibility flag.
