Apologies if this already exists, but I can't find it: I want to know what 
interpretation scopes a constant will be interpreted in.

I assume `Print Scopes` doesn't do what you want, right?

Ok, you may be looking for `Print Visibility`.

Ah, yes, Print Visibility is what I want; thanks!  I guess I didn't look at the 
doc closely enough.
