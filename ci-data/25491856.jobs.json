Dune, is a declarative OCaml-specific build tool that has the\npotential to become the standard build system of the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nDune seems to address the needs of Coq has: well-supported, fast, and\ndesigned for large projects.\n\nIt avoids breaking modularization.\n\nIn the path to become the standard build system for the OCaml ecosystem.\n\n- utop\n- install\n- easy packing => for example errors => cerrors\n- uses a better method than timestamps to detect dependencies\n- it avoids breaking of modularization by spurious forward references\n  as we do [often] today.\n- coqp5, a native-code customized camlp5 executable which brings much\n  faster ml4->ml processing.\n\nFor the moment the plan is for both systems to coexists. Dune uses a\nseparate build directory `_build` and doesn't interfere with the old\nin-tree build.\n\nDune doesn't depend on any 3rd party package other than the OCaml compiler.\n\nDune can indeed be used to replace `coq_makefile`. See an example [here]().\n\n- `make -f Makefile.dune JBOPTS=\"-j 500\" states`\n\n> real\t0m20,586s\n> user\t0m42,354s\n> sys\t0m10,697s\n\n- `./configure -local -native-compiler no && make -j states`:\n\n> real\t0m18,290s\n> user\t0m54,673s\n> sys\t0m10,282s\n\n- 4857\n\n- better search path / coqfind\n- Check that `Drop.` works.\n- Check coqide + workers both in byte and opt\n\nImplement jbuilder / silent mode.\nSplit Coq_config in Coq_base_config == needed subset for jbuilder.\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2018-05-24T03:52:06.000+02:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2018-07-10T17:44:01.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/b8ba9f8d99afa4927b756d5d1c83e437b3339c5c"},"pipeline":{"id":25491856,"iid":2059,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"b8ba9f8d99afa4927b756d5d1c83e437b3339c5c","ref":"pr-6857","status":"failed","source":"push","created_at":"2018-07-10T15:44:45.947Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T16:11:52.120Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/25491856"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/80752530","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":286997,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44949,"description":"shared-runners-manager-4.gitlab.com","ip_address":"13.37.237.197","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-07-17T15:59:40.987Z","tag_list":[]}
