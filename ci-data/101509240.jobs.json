This risk is mitigated in 2 different ways and attenuated\n  by an additional consideration: first, Dune rules are fairly simple\n  and declarative and it is reasonable to expect developers get to\n  know them without too much effort.

This risk\n  can only be mitigated if there is continued developer interest.  In\n  the worst case, Coq could become stuck in a particular Dune version.\n\n- bootstrapping: this is not a problem as witnessed by #8615, Dune can\n  be bootstrapped very easily as it depends only on OCaml and it is\n  designed to do so.\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2018-10-15T18:05:29.000+02:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2019-12-08T17:07:18.000+01:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/08a0b8792290db78c4c5e437bd395df656cbe288"},"pipeline":{"id":101509240,"iid":12503,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"08a0b8792290db78c4c5e437bd395df656cbe288","ref":"pr-8729","status":"failed","source":"push","created_at":"2019-12-08T16:07:33.869Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T16:18:47.139Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/101509240"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/372830641","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":137931,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":null,"artifacts_expire_at":null,"tag_list":[]}
