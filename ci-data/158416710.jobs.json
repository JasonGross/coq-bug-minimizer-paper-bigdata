Additionally, f-c-l revealed a genuine bug in #7825,\nand so I'd like to keep f-c-l in the CI at least until #7825 is\nfinished.\n\nI've been maintaining compatibility of f-c-l with master anyway on the\nside, in part to continue some performance experiments with it, and\nexpect to continue to do so at least until the end of this calendar\nyear, and it'd be nice for me to get advance warning when a PR is going\nto break it on master.  (It seems reasonable to me to take it off the CI\nagain once I'm no longer maintaining it / collecting data from it, and /\nor once #7825 is finished.)\n","author_name":"Jason Gross","author_email":"jgross@mit.edu","authored_date":"2020-06-20T21:32:58.000-04:00","committer_name":"Jason Gross","committer_email":"jgross@mit.edu","committed_date":"2020-06-20T21:32:58.000-04:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/74a6b7de31ce480c7e1814bfba3b6f706837e64b"},"pipeline":{"id":158416710,"iid":16888,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"74a6b7de31ce480c7e1814bfba3b6f706837e64b","ref":"pr-12554","status":"success","source":"push","created_at":"2020-06-21T01:38:50.065Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T04:02:18.428Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/158416710"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/604519257","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":312156,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":null,"artifacts_expire_at":"2020-06-28T01:50:35.866Z","tag_list":[]}
