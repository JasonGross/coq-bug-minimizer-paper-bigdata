We copy in coqide the code for checking the\nvalidity of a filename. We copy it to avoid adding a dependency in\neither Names.check_valid or Stm.dirpath_of_file. We do a minimal check\n(on the basename) while (if it hadn't added extra depencencies or code\nduplication) it would have been more consistent to do the exact same\ncheck as in Stm.dirpath_of_file.\n","author_name":"Hugo Herbelin","author_email":"Hugo.Herbelin@inria.fr","authored_date":"2019-07-23T21:25:12.000+02:00","committer_name":"Hugo Herbelin","committer_email":"Hugo.Herbelin@inria.fr","committed_date":"2019-07-23T21:47:56.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/64906d402e9757af850b9562aaae69099abf871f"},"pipeline":{"id":72555792,"iid":10499,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"64906d402e9757af850b9562aaae69099abf871f","ref":"pr-10557","status":"success","source":"push","created_at":"2019-07-23T19:56:10.506Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T07:44:10.085Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/72555792"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/257692436","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":303474,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44028,"description":"shared-runners-manager-3.gitlab.com","ip_address":"35.196.21.178","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2019-07-30T20:13:24.305Z","tag_list":[]}
