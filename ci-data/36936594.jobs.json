A non-negligible number of\n  developers have expressed discomfort with make and the amount of\n  required knowledge to master make seems way higher than what you\n  need to use Dune.\n\n- lack of flexibility: indeed, Dune is way less flexible than\n  make. Dune only knows how to do well two things: building OCaml\n  executables and libraries. However, that is basically 99% of what\n  building Coq entails; building other parts [documentation or Coq\n  libraries] is fairly straightforward and seem to pose not a problem.\n\n- lack of maturity: indeed, Dune develops fast, it is not free of\n  bugs, and some amount of adaptation is expected from us. This risk\n  can only be mitigated if there is continued developer interest.  In\n  the worst case, Coq could become stuck in a particular Dune version.\n\n- bootstrapping: this is not a problem as witnessed by #8615, Dune can\n  be bootstrapped very easily as it depends only on OCaml and it is\n  designed to do so.\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2018-10-15T18:05:29.000+02:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2018-11-17T07:10:33.000+01:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/b4b5c4e2f4255e45751dc02a6cde5c871bcc7708"},"pipeline":{"id":36936594,"iid":5366,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"b4b5c4e2f4255e45751dc02a6cde5c871bcc7708","ref":"pr-8729","status":"failed","source":"push","created_at":"2018-11-17T06:10:55.515Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T15:45:11.666Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/36936594"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/121798875","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":237924,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":380986,"description":"shared-runners-manager-5.gitlab.com","ip_address":"34.74.209.140","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-11-24T06:27:10.393Z","tag_list":[]}
