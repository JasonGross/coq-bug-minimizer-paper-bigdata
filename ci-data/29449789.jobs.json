It provides automatic generation of\n`version.ml`, `.merlin`, `META`, `opam`, API documentation; install\nmanagement; easy integration with external libraries, test runners,\nand modular builds.\n\nIn particular, Dune uniformly handles components regardless whether\nthey live in, or out-of-tree. This greatly simplifies cases where a\nplugin [or CoqIde] is checked out in the current working copy but then\ndistributed separately [and vice-versa]. Dune can thus be used as a\nmore flexible `coq_makefile` replacement.\n\nFor now we provide experimental support for a Dune build. In order to\nbuild Coq + the standard library with Dune type:\n\n```\n$ make -f Makefile.dune world\n```\n\nThis PR includes a preliminary, developer-only preview of Dune for\nCoq. There is still ongoing work, see\nhttps://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8052 for tracking status towards\nfull support.\n\nDune works out of the box with Coq, once we have fixed some modularity\nissues. The main remaining challenge was to support `.vo` files.\n\nAs Dune doesn't support custom build rules yet, to properly build\n`.vo` files we provide a small helper script `tools/coq_dune.ml`. The\nscript will scan the Coq library directories and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript uses `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files. `coq_dune` is akin to `coq_makefile` and should be able to\nbe used to build Coq projects in the future.\n\nDue to this pitfall, the build process has to proceed in three stages:\n1) build `coqdep` and `coq_dune`; 2) generate `dune` files for\n`theories` and `plugins`; 3) perform a regular build with all\ntargets are in scope.\n\nCoq has a moderately complex build system and it is not a secret that\nmany developer-hours have been spent fighting with `make`.\n\nIn particular, the current `make`-based system does offer poor support\nto verify that the current build rules and variables are coherent, and\nrequires significant manual, error-prone. Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas `opam`, `ocamlfind` or `odoc`. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there has been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons. Dune, is a declarative, OCaml-specific build tool that is on\nthe path to become the standard build system for the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nDune seems to be a good fit for Coq well: it is well-supported, fast,\ncompositional, and designed for large projects.\n\nThe current, make-based build system is unmodified by this PR and kept\nas the default option.
