Dune uses a\nseparate build directory `_build` and doesn't interfere with the old\nin-tree build.\n\n=== What dependencies does Dune require?\n\nDune doesn't depend on any 3rd party package other than the OCaml compiler.\n\n=== Does Dune replace `coq_makefile`?\n\nDune can indeed be used to replace `coq_makefile`. See an example [here]().\n\n=== Why all the `.mli-> .ml` changes?\n\n`.mli`-only modules, \"without implementation\", are not properly\nsupported by the OCaml compiler.

Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\n=== Status / TODO\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe patch depends on some minor changes to the codebase, mainly to\nadapt Coq's source code to Dune-specific module-packing method\nstructure and to avoid spurious dependencies.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\n=== Status / TODO\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe patch depends on some minor changes to the codebase, mainly to\nadapt Coq's source code to Dune-specific module-packing method\nstructure and to avoid spurious dependencies.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality.
