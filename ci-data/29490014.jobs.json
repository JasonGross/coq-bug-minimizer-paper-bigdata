Example:\n\n```coq\nSet Primitive Projections.\nSet Universe Polymorphism.\n\nNonCumulative Record NullGenerators : Type := Build_NullGenerators\n  { ngen_indices : Type;  ngen_type : ngen_indices -> Type }.\n\nNonCumulative Record Nullification_Modality : Type := Nul\n  { unNul : NullGenerators }.\n\nVariables (Lex : Nullification_Modality -> Type).\n\nGoal forall (B : NullGenerators), False.\nProof.\nintros B.\nassert (Lex (Nul B)) as X; [admit|].\npose (O := Nul B).\nfold O in X.\n```\n\nGaëtan notes that this is likely due to `EConstr.eq_constr` not using\nthe `evar_map` for universe variables. This seems like a serious bug.\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2017-12-08T04:44:55.000+01:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2018-09-05T18:23:07.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/ce9e8bccfdbedea6cbd85124d9b4146657072e7f"},"pipeline":{"id":29490014,"iid":2971,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"ce9e8bccfdbedea6cbd85124d9b4146657072e7f","ref":"pr-6343","status":"success","source":"push","created_at":"2018-09-05T16:24:39.415Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T18:59:24.102Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/29490014"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/95010250","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":277767,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44028,"description":"shared-runners-manager-3.gitlab.com","ip_address":"35.196.21.178","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-09-12T16:42:37.033Z","tag_list":[]}
