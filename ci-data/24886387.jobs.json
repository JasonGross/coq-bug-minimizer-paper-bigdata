Strings are split into tokens using the Coq lexer,\nthen the list of tokens are diffed using the Myers algorithm.  A fixup routine\n(Pp_diff.shorten_diff_span) shortens the span of the diff result in some cases.\n\nDiffs can be enabled with the Coq commmand \"Set Diffs on|off|removed.\" or\n\"-diffs on|off|removed\" on the OS command line.  The \"on\" option shows only the\nnew item with added text, while \"removed\" shows each modified item twice--once\nwith the old value showing removed text and once with the new value showing\nadded text.\n\nThe highlights use 4 tags to specify the color and underline/strikeout.\nThese are \"diffs.added\", \"diffs.removed\", \"diffs.added.bg\" and \"diffs.removed.bg\".\nThe first two are for added or removed text; the last two are for\nunmodified parts of a modified item.\n\nDiffs that span multiple strings in the Pp are tagged with \"start.diff.*\" and\n\"end.diff.*\", but only on the first and last strings of the span.\n","author_name":"Jim Fehrle","author_email":"jfehrle@sbcglobal.net","authored_date":"2018-04-09T13:16:46.000-07:00","committer_name":"Jim Fehrle","committer_email":"jfehrle@sbcglobal.net","committed_date":"2018-06-30T09:35:30.000-07:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/5d8024d810758bfeb463c0b9cc99b4c10511f5a8"},"pipeline":{"id":24886387,"iid":1839,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"5d8024d810758bfeb463c0b9cc99b4c10511f5a8","ref":"pr-6801","status":"success","source":"push","created_at":"2018-06-30T16:40:40.256Z","updated_at":"2018-06-30T18:47:41.755Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/24886387"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/78541314","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":276242,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":380986,"description":"shared-runners-manager-5.gitlab.com","ip_address":"34.74.209.140","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-07-07T16:57:38.190Z","tag_list":[]}
