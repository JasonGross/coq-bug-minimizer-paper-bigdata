This risk is mitigated in 2 different ways and attenuated\n  by an additional consideration: first, Dune rules are fairly simple\n  and declarative and it is reasonable to expect developers get to\n  know them without too much effort.

A non-negligible number of\n  developers have expressed discomfort with make and the amount of\n  required knowledge to master make seems way higher than what you\n  need to use Dune.\n\n- lack of flexibility: indeed, Dune is way less flexible than\n  make.
