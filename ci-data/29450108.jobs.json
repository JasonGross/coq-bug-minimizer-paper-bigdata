Dune, is a declarative, OCaml-specific build tool that is on\nthe path to become the standard build system for the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nDune seems to be a good fit for Coq well: it is well-supported, fast,\ncompositional, and designed for large projects.\n\n### Does Dune replace the make-based build system?\n\nThe current, make-based build system is unmodified by this PR and kept\nas the default option. However, Dune has the potential\n\n### Is this PR complete? What does it provide?\n\nThis PR is ready for developer preview and feedback. The build system\nis functional, however, more work is necessary in order to make Dune\nthe default for Coq.\n\nThe main TODOs are tracked at https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8052\n\nThis PR allows developers to use most of the features of Dune today:\n\n- Modular organization of the codebase; each component is built only\n  against declared dependencies so components are checked for\n  containment more strictly.\n- Hygienic builds; Dune places all artifacts under `_build`.\n- Automatic generation of `.install` files, simplified OPAM workflow.\n- `utop` support, `-opaque` in developer mode, etc...\n- `ml4` files are handled using `coqp5`, a native-code customized\n  camlp5 executable which brings much faster `ml4 -> ml` processing.\n\n### What dependencies does Dune require?\n\nDune doesn't depend on any 3rd party package other than the OCaml compiler.\n\n### Some Benchs:\n\n```\n$ /usr/bin/time make DUNEOPT=\"-j 1000\" -f Makefile.dune states\n59.50user 18.81system 0:29.83elapsed 262%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 302996maxresident)k\n0inputs+646632outputs (0major+4893811minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\n$ /usr/bin/time sh -c \"./configure -local -native-compiler no && make -j states\"\n88.21user 23.65system 0:32.96elapsed 339%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 304992maxresident)k\n0inputs+1051680outputs (0major+5300680minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n```\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2018-05-24T03:52:06.000+02:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2018-09-05T12:02:26.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/920723ab4c1707c0a98c978cdd7742d47e58582f"},"pipeline":{"id":29450108,"iid":2949,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"920723ab4c1707c0a98c978cdd7742d47e58582f","ref":"pr-6857","status":"success","source":"push","created_at":"2018-09-05T10:05:23.229Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T12:43:54.470Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/29450108"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/94831999","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":278655,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44949,"description":"shared-runners-manager-4.gitlab.com","ip_address":"13.37.237.197","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-09-12T10:22:38.161Z","tag_list":[]}
