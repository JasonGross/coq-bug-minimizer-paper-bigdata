The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`. An itemized TODO:\n\n- Improve `configure` to better support `dune`, avoid soft link hacks,\n  implement silent mode for auto-conf.\n- Update / wait for dune new features\n- Better toplevel search path technology.\n- Tweak `Coq_config`, avoid so many dependencies.\n- Install target.\n- Doc target.\n- OPAM / META generation.\n\nCoq has a moderately complex build system and it is not a secret that\nmany developer-hours have been spent fighting with `make`.\n\nIn particular, the current `make`-based system does offer poor support\nto verify that the current build rules and variables are coherent, and\nrequires significant manual, error-prone. Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons. Dune, is a declarative OCaml-specific build tool that has the\npotential to become the standard build system of the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nDune seems to address the needs of Coq has: well-supported, fast, and\ndesigned for large projects.\n\n- utop\n- install\n- easy packing => for example errors => cerrors\n- uses a better method than timestamps to detect dependencies\n- it avoids breaking of modularization by spurious forward references\n  as we do [often] today.\n- coqp5, a native-code customized camlp5 executable which brings much\n  faster ml4->ml processing.\n\nFor the moment the plan is for both systems to coexists. Dune uses a\nseparate build directory `_build` and doesn't interfere with the old\nin-tree build.\n\nDune doesn't depend on any 3rd party package other than the OCaml compiler.\n\nDune can indeed be used to replace `coq_makefile`.
