This is trivially sound and it doesn't seem possible to have\nthe one without the other (except specially for [Set <= v+k] which was\nalready handled).\n\nI don't know an example where this used to fail and now succeeds (the\npoint was to remove an anomaly, but the example\n~~~\nModule Type SG. Definition DG := Type. End SG.\nModule MG : SG. Definition DG := Type : Type. Fail End MG.\n~~~\nnow fails with universe inconsistency.\n\nFix #7695 (soundness bug!).\n","author_name":"Gaëtan Gilbert","author_email":"gaetan.gilbert@skyskimmer.net","authored_date":"2018-06-13T14:16:49.000+02:00","committer_name":"Gaëtan Gilbert","committer_email":"gaetan.gilbert@skyskimmer.net","committed_date":"2018-06-21T15:12:07.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/df5a6f35c040464f69cfa1f32b91877d8ff4e99c"},"pipeline":{"id":24305155,"iid":1571,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"df5a6f35c040464f69cfa1f32b91877d8ff4e99c","ref":"pr-7798","status":"failed","source":"push","created_at":"2018-06-21T13:12:38.309Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T16:40:17.005Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/24305155"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/76515839","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":278051,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44028,"description":"shared-runners-manager-3.gitlab.com","ip_address":"35.196.21.178","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":"2018-06-28T13:47:44.156Z","tag_list":[]}
