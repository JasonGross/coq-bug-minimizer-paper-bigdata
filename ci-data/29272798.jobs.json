The main remaining challenge was to support `.vo` files.\n\nAs Dune doesn't support custom build rules yet, to properly build\n`.vo` files we provide a small helper script `tools/coq_dune.ml`. The\nscript will scan the Coq library directories and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript uses `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files. `coq_dune` is akin to `coq_makefile` and should be able to\nbe used to build Coq projects in the future.\n\nDue to this pitfall, the build process has to proceed in three stages:\n1) build `coqdep` and `coq_dune`; 2) generate `dune` files for\n`theories` and `plugins`; 3) perform a regular build with all\ntargets are in scope.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why Dune?\n\nCoq has a moderately complex build system and it is not a secret that\nmany developer-hours have been spent fighting with `make`.\n\nIn particular, the current `make`-based system does offer poor support\nto verify that the current build rules and variables are coherent, and\nrequires significant manual, error-prone.

Another critical point is build\ncompositionality.
