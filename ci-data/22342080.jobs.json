It provides several advantages such as\nautomatic generation of `version.ml`, `.merlin`, `META`, `opam`, API\ndocumentation, install management, easy integration with external\nlibraries, test runners, and modular builds.\n\nIn particular, Dune uniformly handles components regardless if they\nlive in or out-of-tree. This greatly simplifies cases where a plugin\n[or CoqIde] is check out in the current working copy but then\ndistributed separately [and vice-versa]. Dune can be, thus, used as a\nmore flexible `coq_makefile` replacement.\n\nTo build Coq with Dune type:\n```\nbash jb.sh\n```\n\n=== Implementation summary:\n\nIn Dune, each directory corresponds to a _library_; thus, we provide a\n`jbuild` library specification for each Coq source component. Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\n=== Status / TODO\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe patch depends on some minor changes to the codebase, mainly to\nadapt Coq's source code to Dune-specific module-packing method\nstructure and to avoid spurious dependencies.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

This greatly simplifies cases where a plugin\n[or CoqIde] is check out in the current working copy but then\ndistributed separately [and vice-versa]. Dune can be, thus, used as a\nmore flexible `coq_makefile` replacement.\n\nTo build Coq with Dune type:\n```\nbash jb.sh\n```\n\n=== Implementation summary:\n\nIn Dune, each directory corresponds to a _library_; thus, we provide a\n`jbuild` library specification for each Coq source component. Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\n=== Status / TODO\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe patch depends on some minor changes to the codebase, mainly to\nadapt Coq's source code to Dune-specific module-packing method\nstructure and to avoid spurious dependencies.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`. An itemized TODO:\n\n- Improve `configure` to better support `dune`, avoid soft link hacks,\n  implement silent mode for auto-conf.\n- Update / wait for dune new features\n- Better toplevel search path technology.\n- Tweak `Coq_config`, avoid so many dependencies.\n- Install target.\n- Doc target.\n- OPAM / META generation.\n\n== FAQ:\n\n=== Why Dune?\n\nCoq has a moderately complex build system and it is not a secret that\nmany developer-hours have been spent fighting with `make`.\n\nIn particular, the current `make`-based system does offer poor support\nto verify that the current build rules and variables are coherent, and\nrequires significant manual, error-prone. Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `jbuild` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\n=== Status / TODO\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe patch depends on some minor changes to the codebase, mainly to\nadapt Coq's source code to Dune-specific module-packing method\nstructure and to avoid spurious dependencies.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.

Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons.
