It provides several advantages such as\nautomatic generation of `version.ml`, `.merlin`, `META`, `opam`, API\ndocumentation, install management, easy integration with external\nlibraries, test runners, and modular builds.\n\nIn particular, Dune uniformly handles components regardless if they\nlive in or out-of-tree. This greatly simplifies cases where a plugin\n[or CoqIde] is check out in the current working copy but then\ndistributed separately [and vice-versa]. Dune can be, thus, used as a\nmore flexible `coq_makefile` replacement.\n\nTo build Coq with Dune type:\n```\n$ make -f Makefile.dune world\n```\n\nIn Dune, each directory corresponds to a _library_; thus, we provide a\n`dune` library specification for each Coq source component. Dune\ndoesn't support custom rules, thus we provide a small helper script\n`tools/gen_libbuild.ml` that will scan the codebase and generate the\ncorresponding rules for `.v -> .vo` and `.ml4 -> .ml` builds. The\nscript depends on `coqdep` as to correctly output the dependencies of\n`.v` files.\n\nDune doesn't support dynamic rules, thus the build process goes as: 1)\nbuild `coqdep` with Dune; 2) generate `dune` files for `theories`\nand `plugins`; 3) all targets in scope, regular build.\n\nThe current PR provides support for building the full Coq distribution\nwith Dune, while keeping the current, make-based build system as a\nseparate option.\n\nThe main TODO is to perform some refinement and cleanup on some common\nparts such as configure or `coqdep`. An itemized TODO:\n\n- Improve `configure` to better support `dune`, avoid soft link hacks,\n  implement silent mode for auto-conf.\n- Update / wait for dune new features\n- Better toplevel search path technology.\n- Tweak `Coq_config`, avoid so many dependencies.\n- Install target.\n- Doc target.\n- OPAM / META generation.\n\nCoq has a moderately complex build system and it is not a secret that\nmany developer-hours have been spent fighting with `make`.\n\nIn particular, the current `make`-based system does offer poor support\nto verify that the current build rules and variables are coherent, and\nrequires significant manual, error-prone. Many variables must be\npassed by hand, duplicated, etc... Additionally, our make system\noffers poor integration with now standard OCaml ecosystem tools such\nas OPAM, `ocamlfind` or odoc. Another critical point is build\ncompositionality. Coq is rich in 3rd party contributions, and a big\nshortcoming of the current make system is that it cannot be used to\nbuild these projects; requiring us to maintain a custom tool,\n`coq_makefile`, with the corresponding cost.\n\nIn the past, there are been some efforts to migrate Coq to more\nspecialized build systems, however these stalled due to a variety of\nreasons. Dune, is a declarative OCaml-specific build tool that has the\npotential to become the standard build system of the OCaml ecosystem.\n\nDune seems to address the needs of Coq has: well-supported, fast, and\ndesigned for large projects.\n\nIt avoids breaking modularization.\n\nIn the path to become the standard build system for the OCaml ecosystem.\n\n- utop\n- install\n- easy packing => for example errors => cerrors\n- uses a better method than timestamps to detect dependencies\n- it avoids breaking of modularization by spurious forward references\n  as we do [often] today.\n- coqp5, a native-code customized camlp5 executable which brings much\n  faster ml4->ml processing.\n\nFor the moment the plan is for both systems to coexists. Dune uses a\nseparate build directory `_build` and doesn't interfere with the old\nin-tree build.\n\nDune doesn't depend on any 3rd party package other than the OCaml compiler.\n\nDune can indeed be used to replace `coq_makefile`. See an example [here]().\n\n- `make -f Makefile.dune JBOPTS=\"-j 500\" states`\n\n> real\t0m20,586s\n> user\t0m42,354s\n> sys\t0m10,697s\n\n- `./configure -local -native-compiler no && make -j states`:\n\n> real\t0m18,290s\n> user\t0m54,673s\n> sys\t0m10,282s\n\n- 4857\n\n- better search path / coqfind\n- Check that `Drop.` works.\n- Check coqide + workers both in byte and opt\n\nImplement jbuilder / silent mode.\nSplit Coq_config in Coq_base_config == needed subset for jbuilder.\n","author_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","author_email":"e+git@x80.org","authored_date":"2018-05-24T03:52:06.000+02:00","committer_name":"Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias","committer_email":"e+git@x80.org","committed_date":"2018-07-03T17:53:35.000+02:00","trailers":{},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/commit/c486cebf55e73e1203c44520b50707aae16c6187"},"pipeline":{"id":25053148,"iid":1931,"project_id":6138686,"sha":"c486cebf55e73e1203c44520b50707aae16c6187","ref":"pr-6857","status":"failed","source":"push","created_at":"2018-07-03T15:54:07.941Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T16:27:18.084Z","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/pipelines/25053148"},"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/coq/coq/-/jobs/79129141","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","size":3766,"filename":"job.log","file_format":null}],"runner":{"id":44949,"description":"shared-runners-manager-4.gitlab.com","ip_address":"13.37.237.197","active":true,"paused":false,"is_shared":true,"runner_type":"instance_type","name":"gitlab-runner","online":false,"status":"stale"},"artifacts_expire_at":null,"tag_list":["docker"]}
